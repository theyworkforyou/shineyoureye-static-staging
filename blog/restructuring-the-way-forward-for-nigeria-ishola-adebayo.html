  <h1 class="page-title">Restructuring: The Way Forward for Nigeria! –Ishola Adebayo</h1>

  <p class="meta">April 26, 2018</p>

  <div class="markdown infopage">
    <p>The talk of Nigeria’s success or genuine federalism can no longer hold waters giving the state of internal insurgencies, divisiveness, ethnic and religious schism witnessed in several parts of Nigeria. Efforts at wishing away the problem associated with Nigerian federation have only resulted into several tribal, ethnic and religious movements that have even metamorphosed into terrorist syndicates.</p>

<p>It’s a sad reality that Nigeria today has become a country galvanized with bloodshed, hate speeches, incompetence and poor dynamics of governance at the centre reflecting in every beam and spectrum in our daily discussions. The media has not stopped feeding us with these details because where we ought to be is still a dream to the generation at hand and it seems our hope is still a mirage.</p>

<p>As the lingering challenge continue to unfold, we are called to reflect on why Nigeria was amalgamated in the year 1914 and the set goals that made Nigeria a giant of Africa at present in the world today.</p>

<p>Painstakingly, the northern, southern, western and eastern regions worked together to build the country.
Nevertheless, as the country continues to strive forward, the government needs to do more by creating a structural framework, that is, understanding the times and giving attention to the need of it citizenry, and by identifying innovation and skills in various part of the country that can enhance wealth creation and employment for the rising population.</p>

<p>Allowing hate speeches and incompetence, nepotism will never yield positively rather, promoting fairness, justice and peaceful coexistence among the rising population should be the watchword of all and sundry.</p>

<p>One can, therefore, no longer fold his arms but engage some of the issues that have confronted us as a
nation and threatened the Nigerian federation. That Nigeria could survive despite predictions to the contrary by the World Powers not only portrays a ray of hope but also demonstrate that Nigerian Federation has come to stay.</p>

<p>Nigeria is far behind many Nations and everything possible should be done to take Nigeria to where it rightly belongs among the comity of Nations given her huge and rich minerals and agricultural resources, and population.</p>

<p>It is therefore incumbent on the federal government to fashion out our own type of federalism that is best suited to the people and to local circumstances. There should be genuine efforts to build the nation. Therefore ethnic, religious and sectional agenda should take back place. The essence of federalism is to foster unity and development. This has however, not been achieved.</p>

<p>Consequently, the recruitment processes of our elective office holders are being re-visited in the Electoral Amendment Bill to ensure that the system can recruit the best at all strata of leadership, more importantly and worthy of note is the Not-Too-Young-To-Run Bill. We need leaders who are visionary, selfless, prudent, intelligent,  indefatigable and having integrity and honour to serve.</p>

<p>There is the need for massive awareness to change the mindsets of the rulers and the ruled. I challenge our tertiary institutions to break the disconnect between them and the political institutions and industries not only to fashion out the appropriate curriculum to drive this new orientation to confront our political and economic malaise but also to lead cutting edge research in providing correct local solutions to our diverse of problems.</p>

<p>The power sharing between the Federal Government and the states needs to be revisited and the issues of the autonomy of local governments in Nigeria which state Houses of Assembly keep voting against is saddening.
Also, the issue of resource control must be properly addressed. The communities where those resources are found should be adequately compensated. The call for resource control may by implication have a semblance of territorial devolution.</p>

<p>For Nigeria to move forward, unity most be our watchword. Our votes in 2019 should be the option for our collective progress. Let’s say no to passing of bucks and blame games. We should rather fix our country collectively.</p>

<p>Let’s make proper use of our votes by not selling it, we need to continuously advocate to all young people to register in the ongoing voter’s registration exercise by INEC. Our quest for perfect democracy is not dependent on any cyclic cabals or leaders but on our responsibility as an active citizen. Let’s salvage ourselves and regain freedom from sections of fallacy and failed promises of the past.</p>

<p>Making Nigeria great is our collective responsibilities, that is, it should not be limited to social class or political class. It should be demanded using the appropriate measures by all Nigerians. This gap that amount to the lingering challenges can be fix if we understand the need for a clarion call of one voice.</p>
