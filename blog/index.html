    <div>
      <p>It has been recognised that the budget is perhaps the most important instrument for the development of any modern state apart from the constitution. It can be argued that it is only through the instrumentality of the budget that government can allocate resources to deliver services to the people especially the poor and excluded. But in Nigeria, there are a lot of blockages to effective budgeting. These blockages include lack of participation of citizens in the budget process especially in…</p>

    <div>
      <p>Women are underrepresented in politics globally. African countries – Ethiopia, Rwanda and South Africa – continue to be deliberate about increasing the representation of women in politics. Unfortunately, Nigeria is far behind. Today, Nigeria has one of the lowest rates of female representation in parliament across Africa, and globally, it ranks 181st out of 193 countries according to the International Parliamentary Union. In the current Nigerian 9th National Assembly, women occupy 7 out of 109 Senate seats and only 11…</p>

      <p>Indeed, office of the citizen is the highest office in Nigeria.

      <p>The anti-corruption drive of Mr. President got more kudos upper week when the Director-General of National Intelligence Agency, NIA, Ambassador Ayo Oke, and Secretary to Government of the Federation, Mr. David Babachir Lawal were both suspended. In some quarters, the suspension of these principal figures is long overdue as corrupt acts have been directed towards them. What did they do?</p>
<p>Oke was suspended over the $43 million, £27,000 and N23 million cash found in a luxury apartment at Osborne Towers…</p>

Once these roles are performed, the essence of government comes into place. In our democratic society, since the executive arm needs to execute laws and policies, more “hands” are needed to which the Chief Executive can assign roles to a specific body or person. However, the acting capacity of such entity depends on the confirmation of the legislature.</p>
