      <p>Life returned to the polity with the eventual resumption of plenary by the National Assembly. It goes without saying that the plate is full for the federal legislators, as much is also expected of them from Nigerians.

      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday, May 8th, 2018 took another four-day trip to the United Kingdom to see his doctor. The presidential spokesman, Malan Garba Shehu, stated that the doctor requested the president to return for a meeting which he (Buhari) agreed to do.</p>

      <p>Public outcry continues to trail the turn of event in the Nigeria’s polity, this time, over the recent reinstatement of the former Chairman of Presidential Committee on Pension Reform Task force Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina, into the federal civil service, thereby accusing President Muhammadu Buhari of aiding corruption in his government by earlier feigning ignorance of his reinstatement and promotion only to sack him after continuous public vituperation.</p>

      <p>On Saturday, October 14, Nigerians woke up to see a statue of Jacob Zuma, the South African president unveiled by Rochas Okorocha‚ the Imo state governor. He erected the bronze statue and named a street after President Zuma during his two-day visit to the state. During the unveiling, Governor Rochas also conferred Zuma with a chieftaincy title and the highest Merit Award in Imo State.</p>

Since his election in April 2015, anti-graft war by the administration solely remains media trial, lopsided and inconclusive.

      <p>President Buhari's 2016 “Budget of Change” went missing due to political reasons, a news report has stated. Several thousand of hard and soft copies of the important document allegedly disappeared from the National Assembly, going by media reports on January 12th.</p>
<p>Several senators said they couldn't find their copy of the budget and thus couldn't discuss or pass it during resumption to plenary on Tuesday after their Christmas and New Year recess.</p>
