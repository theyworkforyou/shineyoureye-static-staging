      <p>The people of Rivers state will on Saturday, December 11, vote those who will occupy the state and National Assembly seats that were declared vacant by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).</p>

<p>The elections, according to the commission, would hold in all three senatorial districts, eight federal constituencies, and 10 state constituencies and would deploy 10,294 staff to conduct the elections in Rivers State.</p>

<p>In the face of the claims and counter-claims, including allegation that Governor Nyesom Wike had been targeted for assassination, the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, have pleaded with frightened Corps members, who earlier volunteered to supervise the elections, not to back out ahead of  Saturday’s parliamentary rerun elections in Rivers State.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have continued to trade accusations over acts capable of causing violence during the exercise.</p>

<p>The Rivers State Police Commissioner, Mr Francis Odesanya has placed restriction on movement in all parts of the state from 12 midnight on Friday to 8pm on Saturday.</p>

<p>It is hope that security agencies would douse the tension currently ravaging Rivers State and ensure a conducive atmosphere for elections to be conducted on Saturday.</p>

    <p class="meta">November 25, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>History plays a role and shapes our future. Today, I share with you critical issues, facts and matters arising as the people of Ondo State prepare to exercise their franchise in electing its 17th Governor &amp; 6th Democratic Governor on Saturday, November 26, 2016.</p>

<p>According to Benajmin Todd Jealous; “The right to vote is the right upon which all of our rights are leveraged and without which none can be protected.”</p>

<p>Ondo State with a population of 4.02 million (Nigeria Bureau of Statistics, 2011)  is one of the six states in the South-West Geopolitical Zone of Nigeria and was created on February 3, 1976 out of the defunct Western Region. It consists of eighteen (18) local government areas with Akure serving as its capital.</p>

<p>As the front runners for Ondo Guber poll – the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Alliance for Democracy (AD) and All Progressives Congress (APC) – in rounding off their campaigns, pundits would have began an uneasy permutation about the possible outcome of Saturday’s contest with no one ready to place a bet on any of the three leading candidates: Mr. Eyitayo Jegede (PDP), Chief Olusola Oke (AD) and Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu (APC).</p>

<p>The outgoing governor, Olusegun Mimiko before defecting to the People’s Democracy Party during the buildup to 2015 general elections was elected in 2012 under the platform of the Labour Party with 260,199 votes against the PDP and ACN with 155,961 and 143, 512 votes respectively.</p>

<p>In deciding who succeeds Mr. Olusegun Mimiko as the Governor of Ondo State come Saturday, November 26th, the citizens have to make a choice between the 28 INEC Approved Candidates that would participate in the November 26th governorship election in the State.</p>

<p>Over 1.66million Registered Voters are expected to vote in the 3,009 Polling Units across the State with about 3,694 Smart Card Readers deployed by INEC for the election. There are over 330, 218 Unclaimed Voter’s card as at October 31, 2016 despite the CVR exercise by the electoral umpire in Ondo State.</p>

<p>With the economic recession currently pervading the country, Domestic Debt Profile of Ondo State as at December 2015 stood at N26.6 billion with External Debt profile of $51.7 million as at June 30, 2016. The State is currently running with the Budget of N123.7billion for the year 2016.</p>

<p>Some of the critical issues that engulfs Ondo State, the Sunshine State of Nigeria ranges from Unpaid bursary for Ondo students in tertiary institution since 2014, Unpaid worker’s salaries for about five months, Over 2 years power outage in Okitipupa Local Government Area, Six suspended lecturers from Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba, Alape Bridge which links Okitipupa, Irele, Ilaje and Ese together has been abandoned/uncompleted for over 8 years.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/house-reps-and-purchase-exotic-cars-matters-arisin">House of Reps and the Purchase of Exotic Cars: Matters Arising! –Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">November 18, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>Amid the hard-biting economic downturn in the country, the National Assembly has paid a whopping N3.6billion for 360 exotic cars which the House of Representatives has taken delivery of no fewer than 28 units of the Peugeot 508 series. The 28 were among the first batch of 50 cars supplied by the Kaduna-based Peugeot Automobile Nigeria Limited.</p>

<p>Active citizens have overtime argued that, for the legislators to prioritise buying for themselves some luxury vehicles at a time most Nigerians are going through difficult times demonstrates a high level of insensitivity and recklessness.</p>

<p>The cars will cost taxpayers an estimated N3.6billion that could be spent on vaccinating newborns and save them from dying or on providing electricity for remote communities so kids stop doing school assignments using paraffin lamps.</p>

<p>The lower legislative chamber is buying the vehicles at a time millions of Nigerians are facing severe economic hardship, including nonpayment of salaries.</p>

<p>Indeed, at a period when there is a compelling need for the elected representatives of the people to ensure robust and timely legislation and oversight so that Nigerians can begin to enjoy the benefits of good governance, the lawmakers seem to care more about their privileges.</p>

<p>Indeed, this current National Assembly, especially the House of Representatives, is about to set the standard on how a legislature can become a subversion of all the ethical aspirations that ought to drive a society.</p>

<p>If these exotic cars are needed for necessary oversight trips to difficult terrains as being touted, why not buy a dozen of such vehicles and put them in a pool that the lawmakers can sign for when such official trips become imperative?</p>

<p>The sheer lack of transparency that shrouds this transaction and the magnitude of the financial outlay are reflective of the enormous rot in our polity. While it is doubtful if the lawmakers who have already taken possession of the vehicles will return them, hopefully they will understand that they are fast losing credibility with Nigerians they are expected to serve.</p>

    <p class="meta">November 11, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>The Senate penultimate week sent a shock wave down the spines of Nigerians and aviation industry, as it declared that multiple air crashes are imminent. It was like saying the turbulent aviation Year 2005/6 with worst cases of plane crashes in the country, is sudden upon the country again!</p>

<p>A single air crash, from antecedent, is enough to ground an airline and two or three of such will bury an entire sector that ordinarily offers the safest means of traveling around the world.</p>

<p>The scary outburst followed a motion tagged; “Disturbing Development in the Nigerian Aviation Industry” by Senator Dino Melaye which was backed by Senator Godswill Akpabio.</p>

<p>While the National Assembly has the right to its observations particularly in the area of adopting policies and making laws through the process of deliberation which are the bedrock of good governance, it becomes worrisome when the upper chamber decides to complicate issues affecting the aviation sector under the pretense of finding solutions.</p>

<p>It is true that all is not well with airline business and even the sector in general, but for the upper chamber to come out to shout of imminent plane crashes is a disservice to the country’s aviation sector.</p>

<p>The wrong signal sent out not only to the travelling public and the outside world of imminent crashes, the lawmakers have indirectly indicted itself by failing to assist the sector in times of difficulties they have listed out only to come out to raise the alarm.</p>

<p>What does #OurNASS stand to gain by coming out to create tension in a sector that is struggling to remain?</p>

<p>Agreed that the sector is facing a lot of challenges, but coming out with such an alarm falls short of expectations from the lawmakers. Like Nigeria, other countries have their own challenges but their leaders will never destroy the entire system through such an unguarded statement.</p>

<p>If the lawmakers know that much about the problems confronting the sector, they should be more proactive in finding solutions to them rather than make remarks that will further compound issues.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/nass-amendment-ccbcct-act-matters-arising-ishola-a">NASS Amendment of CCB/CCT Act: Matters Arising! -Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">November 4, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>The Senate last week Thursday amended the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act (CCB/CCT Act) respectively, which is to effectively transfer the President’s regulatory power over the bureau and tribunal to the National Assembly.</p>

<p>We are no doubt taken aback that just months after the red chamber initially suspended the move to amend the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) and the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) Act, the National Assembly subtly passed the amendment Bill into law.</p>

<p>The Senate also reintroduced a provision which authorizes the CCB to invite anyone found culpable in asset declaration to make necessary correction as against being charged to the tribunal for trial – a provision that had earlier been expunged from the extant law.</p>

<p>For many who don’t know, the 3rd &amp; 5th Schedule to our constitution of 1999 as amended emphasizes on important parts of CCT’s existence and only a constitutional amendment can make changes to it.</p>

<p>This constitutional amendment can’t be done by just the Senate, it must be consented to by 2/3 of all our 36 State Houses of Assembly; without which, the provisions of 3rd &amp; 5th schedule stands, the Senate can’t make any changes or modification to the Act as it so exist right now.</p>

<p>Never mind that the Senate went ahead to making amendments that doesn’t comply with the provisions of CCB/CCT as provided by the 3rd &amp; 5th; It will mean the constitution will be invalid, null and void to the extent of its inconsistencies. The amendment can’t stand.</p>

<p>Now let us highlight some of the salient part of the invalid amendment of CCB/CCT Act by the National Assembly and point out where it fails…</p>

<p>The ‘SHALL’ clause in the constitution makes the 3rd &amp; 5th law Mandatory and NEVER optional.</p>

<p>– National Assembly altered the tenure of CCB Chairman to a term of 5yrs renewable once. This is inconsistent with Paragraph 17 (1) of the 5th Schedule in our constitution.</p>

<p>The Paragraph also says the Chairman SHALL vacate his office at the age of 70 years. The word used is “SHALL” and very mandatory.</p>

<p>Therefore the amendment by The National Assembly limiting term of CCB Chairman to 5yrs renewable once is hereby NULL and VOID for being inconsistent with the constitution.</p>

<p>It is crystal clear that the amendment is in conflict with the Nigerian constitution and that those in the senate are not studious enough, even the 1(3) schedule provides that any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution shall be null and void.</p>

<p>The National Assembly can only amend a constitutional Act if amendment is made and supported by 2/3 of all 36 States House of Assembly.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this same National Assembly that has delayed the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which could create jobs for many unemployed Nigerians, was quick to amend the CCT/CCB Act, arrogating to itself the power to control both the CCB and CCT, because it serves its interest.</p>

<p>Overall, the amendment process is perceived as an exercise by the National Assembly to take away the role of the executive in the appointment of Judges of the body due to the ongoing travails of the Senate President with the tribunal, no more, no less!</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/nominees-rejection-president-buharis-ambassadorial">Nominees’ Rejection of President Buhari's Ambassadorial Position: Matters Arising! –Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">October 27, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>The ambassadorial nominee from Kastina state, Usman Bugaje, has turned down his appointment nomination by President Muhammadu Buhari. Dr Bugaje, an academic, rights campaigner, former member House of Representatives was also one of the gubernatorial aspirants in Katsina State.</p>

<p>Bugaje is the second nominee to reject the offer, after Pauline Tallen, a former deputy governor of Plateau state and associate of Aisha Buhari, wife of Nigeria’s president turned down the offer as well.</p>

<p>It could be recalled that President Buhari recently submitted a list of 46 non-career ambassadors designate for confirmation by the Senate.</p>

<p>While Pauline Tallen rejected her nomination on the grounds that there was no “proper consultation”, a decision she announced in public, Usman Bugaje prevailed upon by top government officials not to announce his rejection of the offer as reported in some section of the media.</p>

<p>The culture of placing a square peg in a round hole must stop in our nation’s polity. Non-consultation of nominees for appointment is a show of incompetence and arrogance on the part of those in charge of affairs now. You could accuse former President Goodluck Jonathan’s government of incompetence. Those steering the state ship now have added arrogance to it.</p>

<p>Even more disappointing is the way people are being allocated appointment without taking into perspective of what they can offer. Example is the way portfolios were allocated to ministers. They don’t even have the share of minds to know where people could fit in, they don’t consult but just go ahead to make announcement.  It is very disappointing and Nigeria needs to be safe of this future embarrassment.</p>

<p>Nigeria’s First Lady, Aisha Buhari unforgettable interview spoilt one of her husband’s rare promising moments—Boko Haram’s release of twenty-one Chibok schoolgirls. In a BBC Hausa interview, she expressed her displeasure in President Buhari’s government, saying that the President does not know most of the appointees in his cabinet and that PMB’s government is currently been controlled by the Aso Villa Cabals. She succinctly emphasized that the Presidency had been hijacked by a few people, who were behind the presidential appointments.</p>

<p>In the interview, Mrs. Buhari said, “The president does not know 45 out of 50, for example, of the people he appointed and I don’t know them either, despite being his wife of 27 years. Some people are sitting down in their homes, folding their arms, only for them to be called to come and head an agency or a ministerial position.”</p>

<p>With this media outburst from Nigeria’s First Lady, somebody we believe should know her husband too well. It therefore paint the clear picture that a good number of people in the President’s cabinet are misfits and square pegs forcing themselves into round holes. So to that extent, I agree that a lot of the cabinet members should simply give way. What if a man who says he is not corrupt is incompetent, what good is he to us?</p>

<p>Nigerians are suffering, yet people are pretending as if everything is fine. The value of naira has dropped by 70 per cent over one year, yet President Buhari and his cabinet members are still blaming the previous administration.</p>

<p>President Buhari no doubt confirmed his wife’s depiction of a man who is so bewildered by the demands of his office that he has ceded control to others in his graceless response which of course the Presidency handlers had effortlessly tried to pass off as witticism.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/call-sale-national-assets-whose-interest-ishola-ad">Call for the Sale of National Assets: In whose Interest?  -Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">October 14, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>The recent call by Aliko Dangote for the sale of the national shareholdings in the NLNG and the suggestions by the senate president that the shares, along with other sovereign assets in the oil and aviation sectors, be sold to stem the current economic recession are suspicious, unacceptable and unpatriotic, there seems to be a sinister motive behind the call for the sale of our common patrimony.</p>

<p>Those angling to sell or buy Nigeria’s cherished national assets don’t seem to believe in Nigeria. They don’t seem to believe that there is a future for Nigeria. For them, the Nigeria they know and believe in is the Nigeria of today. What you call Nigeria, in their mind, may evaporate into another “there was a country”, in the words of Chinua Achebe.</p>

<p>That is why they want to sell off whatever assets belong to the country so that when it comes to pass that there was once a country called Nigeria, they will live and own those assets in whatever new political entity they find themselves. Otherwise, why should any patriotic citizen contemplate selling of our national assets in the guise of tackling recession? In whose interest is this selfish agenda?</p>

<p>Investments in the NLNG and Joint Venture oil upstream operations are profitable and represent potential sources of revenue in the future. These calls are more worrisome when one considers the history of sovereign assets divestiture in the past.  Where are the proceeds from sales of the assets in the power sector for instance?</p>

<p>Latching on the current economic downturn as reason to sell the assets is just a ploy because Nigeria is not the only country currently in recession. Nigeria is just one out of a host of countries that are now in “the recession club”. None of those countries has put up its priced national assets for sale. What the countries are engaged in is critical thinking to devise creative strategies to boost production. Selling of national assets is tantamount to cutting the head because one has headache. The Igbo say a madman sets his house on fire to allow more light!</p>

<p>Countries that have had recession often come out stronger due to the proactive policies put in place that wouldn’t have been there without the recession. Therefore, recession is not a death knell on any country. All that is required is unrelenting thinking devoid of egocentric or ethnic maneuvering.</p>

    <div>
      <p>On Tuesday, 4th October, 2016; Enough Is Enough Nigeria (EiE) with other partner organizations started the #Office of the Citizen radio programme that had been in the making over sometime in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. Thanks to Sweet 107.1FM crew, especially Mr. Toye Arulogun and Olaitan Bakare, we finally got a 60-minute weekly slot to discuss various issues that are of great concern to Nigerians in English and Yoruba Language.</p>

<p>These issues may revolve around Access to Power, holding public officials accountable, getting good services from government and privately owned agencies, and other topical issues that may be relevant to the host community. We hope that every listener will soon believe that the Office of the Citizen they occupy is actually the highest office in the land!</p>

<p>Unlike other call-in programs, the distinguishing factor of the ‘Office of the Citizen’ radio show would be its singular objective of educating listeners and helping callers solve problems related to the focus areas. Callers will be allowed to vent, but ultimately, the focus will be on how to help them turn their anger/frustrations into action and results.</p>

<p>Every Tuesday from 11am-12noon, EiE in partnership with Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC) and BudgIT will discuss various governance - related issues including engaging government officials, budgets, gender based violence and other women’s rights abuse.</p>

<p>Guests on the first episode were Ishola Adebayo of EiE Nigeria, Emmanuela Azu of WARDC and ‘Funso Oladapo of BudgIT Nigeria. Alongside our wonderful co-hosts Akinwande Ogundele and Ayinla Egba. We took our listeners on a 1-hour ride through the overview of the show and of course issues around Local Government Administration in Nigeria and the forthcoming LGAs/LCDA elections in Ogun State.</p>

<p>Join us every Tuesday by 11am on SWEET 107.1 FM as we take on topical issues of concern to Nigerians. Tweet with the hashtag #OfficeOfTheCitizen or call in: 09020931071, 09020941071, 08148444994 to join the conversation!</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/nigeria-56-hope-horizon-ishola-adebayo">Nigeria @ 56: Hope in the Horizon –Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">September 30, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>Fifty six years in the life of a nation is, indeed, a milestone worth celebrating. Within this period, the country, Nigeria, and her people passed through many phases of ups and downs and survived the heat of a desiccating crucible. The immediate post-2015 election process presented its own challenges as the leaders and the citizenry grappled with the demands of nation building. The initial false steps were, at first, dramatic resulting in upheavals that not only scared us in what seems not only to truncate the democratic structures, but threatened to dismember the nation. Yet, the country survives still. Though not without its democratic experiment. It was a testy time for a nation that survived 16 years of democratic misrule and struggling to pick up the gauntlet of self-governance.</p>

<p>Whether we like to admit it or not, we are living through troubling times. After 56 years of independence, Nigeria remains a story of false starts, a nation on reverse gear. With all the huge human and natural resources that God has endowed us with, there is absolutely no reason why we should be where we are today. Many years of bad government and failed leadership gave rise to an entrenched system of corruption, mediocrity and impunity.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of people who die every day in this country because they are simply too poor to stay alive. They have no jobs, therefore, no means of sustenance for themselves and their families. When they are sick they cannot afford to go to the hospital or to procure medication. A lot of Nigerians cannot afford to pay the school fees of their children. These are not numbers; they are human beings whose dignity have been bruised and battered because of the burdensome weight of life’s unbearable challenges. In virtually every sector of our economy, the indices are at an all-time low. Social infrastructures including schools, hospitals, roads, electricity, water supply, and even prisons are at their worst state than at any other moment in the history of this country.</p>

<p>While the independence anniversary for many nations of the world is a privileged time to celebrate progress and prosperity, for Nigeria, it is always a sober moment for lamentation. After the last general elections that brought a new government to power, Nigerians have once again expressed their resilient hope and undying optimism that things will be better this time around. However, we are yet to see an overwhelming commitment from the generality of Nigerians that we are really prepared for the sacrifices that change entails.</p>

<p>We are still living with warped values, from things as minute as obeying traffic rules, proper sanitation, and respect for decency, order and protocol in public places. We are yet to shed all manner of brazen wrongdoing from corner cutting, queue jumping and rule breaking that have made this country a republic of organised anarchy. We are still living with a culture of militarisation where the security agencies of the state continue to terrorise hapless citizens with the might of their guns, sirens and uniforms.</p>

<p>After 56 years of independence, Nigeria has no single world-class university, airport, tourist attraction site, industry or product. How can a nation rise on the ladder of social prosperity without these trappings of modern economic development? All we see on a daily basis are ethnic rifts, political polarisations and religious divisions. Is this how a nation becomes great? According to Lee Kuan Yew, the first Prime Minister of Singapore, “A nation is great not by its size alone. It is the will, the cohesion, the stamina, the discipline of its people, and the quality of their leaders which ensure it an honourable place in history.”</p>

<p>I believe that at all levels of government and society, Nigeria needs an ethical leadership to inspire, articulate and drive change, an individual who will echo the rallying cry and hunger for substantial dialogue and justice; a leader who has a soul, who is committed, competent, and courageous; with a core vision and sense of mission and willing to sacrifice for them by taking on vested interests and anti-democratic forces.</p>

<p>For the country and the people, it has been 56 years of hard work, fears, anxieties, hopes, aspirations, successes and failures. Most importantly, it has been a period that gives everyone reasons to believe in a bright and prosperous future.</p>

<p>Certainly, we have not reached our final destination as regards our march towards growth and development but we have made significant gains and cannot afford to destroy what we have toiled to build.</p>

<p>Looking into the future, we must continue to focus our attention on having a cleaner government by voting for a less corruptible leader. Nigeria is where we are because of incompetent and corrupt leadership that has governed us for far too long. We, as active citizens, must endeavor to get involve in electing incorruptible leaders to govern the affairs of the country.</p>

<p>While some may disagree that there were no reasons to celebrate, it cannot for one minute be lost on us that we as a nation have come a long way and have had a lot of experience, good, bad and ugly. The pace of growth and development may actually lack some sense of determination and urgency, the results so far may be mixed, but the HOPE that is in the horizon which engulfs our nation as the pride of the entire continent after some 56 years of numerous challenges is what I choose to celebrate.</p>

<p>After all is said and done, the only way to shut those naysayers, will be our resolve to remain hopeful and believe in the course we are charting. Hence, in spite of all, I celebrate our achievements in the past 56 years, because I believe they are the foundational blocks of our development.</p>

<p>Therefore, above all challenges, I choose to remain hopeful. Nigeria will join the league of great nations someday, a day not too far from now.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/quest-part-time-legislature-its-implication-govern">The Quest for Part Time Legislature: It’s Implication on Governance in Nigeria –Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">September 21, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>When the talk about part time legislature is been debated, people’s minds go to allowances, salaries and other benefits. But that is not really the issue. The issue is the overhead cost. If the overhead cost is not controlled — as it relates to the executive, legislature and the judiciary — we cannot achieve a reasonable reduction in the cost of governance. Even if somebody works for two months but run a very high overhead cost, we would not achieve any cost reduction.</p>

<p>Full-time legislature is a waste of resources and time. The work of a legislator does not justify his being there on a full-time basis. I have had the opportunity to serve the country there through the youth corps programme. To be honest, the work could be better done on part-time. The enormity of work in the Senate — which is the highest level of lawmaking — is not enough to occupy the Senate every day of the week.</p>

<p>That is why they work three days –Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Yet, the three days are not fully utilized. Most of the time, they are busy with their personal activities. They spend much of the time discussing exorbitant allowances.</p>

<p>They can achieve both legislative and oversight functions working on a part-time basis. By the way, what is the essence of oversight responsibility? They use the opportunity to make money for themselves. Rather than keeping ministries, departments and agencies on their toes, they go about soliciting for money.</p>

<p>Many Nigerians are of the right opinion that many of the legislators are short changing the country and the National Assembly with regular absenteeism, irregular and untimely arrival for sessions which result in low productivity.</p>

<p>Pitiably, Nigerians watch with dismay how members stroll into the legislative chamber when the proceeding in the Red and Green Chambers is almost concluded without visible respect for the time schedules in the parliament, yet these are leaders whom we are expecting to lay good examples, serves as models for emulation.</p>

<p>In all developed countries Nigeria is trying to emulate, members of the legislature have their professions and they don’t resign their appointments to become lawmakers. Part time legislature would be good if the Federal Government wants to attract high-calibre people to politics.</p>

<p>There is nothing stopping an accountant, lecturer or banker from venturing into politics and do it part time. This would enable them to still hold on to their jobs and do politics. It will be beneficial because all these people are coming with skills and experiences from their own professions. So why can’t we use these skills and experiences in shaping our country?</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/edo-governorship-election-postponed-implications-p">Edo Governorship Election postponed: Implications for the polity!!! –Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">September 15, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>The decision to postpone the Edo State governorship election slated for last week is a clear indication that the police lack the desirable capacity in policing this country. The controversy generated is a clear testimony that the police and the other security agencies are part of election malpractices in the country.</p>

<p>It is no longer news that some senior security officials were retired or dismissed over the roles they played in the last general election. But it appears that the current administration has yet to learn to do things differently. A similar scenario played out during the botched senatorial rerun in Imo State, where the election was postponed in a controversial manner.</p>

<p>Obviously, we are no doubt reaping the tragedy of the decision by a former National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki (retd.), who used insecurity to blackmail INEC into postponing the presidential election so that his party could gain an advantage. Dasuki became openly partisan. I find such an act extremely abominable.</p>

<p>If, indeed, Edo State was a target for an attack and the police and the DSS could not uncover that before the President visited, then we are in trouble. If the huge number of policemen and soldiers deployed could not secure the state, then Nigeria is in a serious problem.</p>

<p>The implication of this for our nascent democracy is that our security operatives are not trained to combat security challenges. They are not prepared to protect the country. We do not have a security apparatus that can be relied upon.</p>

<p>Beyond election, we must equip the Nigeria Police Force to be able to combat security threats. We are not serious about policing. How could we expect the governors to equip the police but dismiss state policing? In terms of the number of personnel and equipment, the NPF is not ready to protect the country.</p>

<p>We did not realize how poorly equipped the military was until Boko Haram emerged. We only realized that our arsenal was empty when Boko Haram started bombing the North. That is how terrible we are in terms of security. We must beef up our security in terms of armory and personnel.</p>

    <p class="meta">September 7, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>History plays a role and shapes our future. Today, I share with you critical issues, facts and matters arising as the people of Edo State prepare to exercise their franchise in electing its 10th Governor &amp; 5th Democratic Governor on Saturday, September 10th,2016.</p>

<p>According to Benajmin Todd Jealous; “The right to vote is the right upon which all of our rights are leveraged and without which none can be protected.”</p>

<p>Edo State is one of the six states in the South-South Geopolitical Zone of Nigeria and was created on August 27, 1991 out of the old Bendel state. It consists of eighteen (18) Local Government areas with Benin serving as its capital.</p>

<p>On 20 March 2008, an election tribunal nullified the election of Oserheimen Osunbor of the People's Democratic Party,(PDP) and declared erstwhile labour leader Comrade Adams Oshiomhole of the Action Congress as the winner of the 14 April, 2007 governorship election. The judgement was based on several electoral malpractices observed during the election. Oshiomhole was voted for a second term in 2012. Governor Adams Oshiomhole was re-elected under the platform of the then Action Congress of Nigeria with 477, 478 votes against the PDP and ANPP with 144, 235 and 3,642 votes respectively.</p>

<p>The Governor of Edo State is elected using the Open Secret Ballot System. The outgoing governor, Adams Oshiomhole, is ineligible to run for a third consecutive term due to term limits established in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>

<p>In deciding  who succeeds Comrade Adams Oshiomhole as the Governor of Edo State come Saturday September 10th, the citizens have to make a choice between the 19 political parties that would participate in the September 10 governorship election in the State.</p>

<p>According to the INEC Approved Candidates, 19 gubernatorial aspirants; 15 male running mates and four female running mates will be participating in the Guber poll.</p>

<p>Over 1.92million Registered Voters are expected to vote in the 2, 627 Polling Units across the State with about over 400, 000 Unclaimed Permanent Voter’s Card as at August 2016 despite the CVR process by the electoral umpire.</p>

<p>With the current economic recession trend in the country, Domestic Debt Profile of Edo State as at December 2015 stood at N66.2 billion and the state is currently running with the Budget of N116.6billion for the year 2016.  Some of the critical issues that pervade Edo State, the Heart Beat of Nigeria ranges from Unpaid salaries for Local Council Workers, Pension &amp; Gratuity Arrears, Stalled &amp; Uncompleted Projects across the state.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/economic-recession-nigeria-matters-arising-ishola-">Economic recession in Nigeria: Matters Arising! -Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">September 1, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>On Tuesday, the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) confirmed what we all suspected: Nigeria is in recession. The economy contracted by 2% in the second quarter, and unemployment is also on the rise. Many have lost their jobs in the formal sector as firms have cut staff or folded up altogether. Many of us know people who have been let go in all sectors, and hiring has slowed to a trickle.</p>

<p>Unemployment has risen for the seventh straight quarter, and is now 13.3%. For the first time since 2009, Nigeria’s service sector has shrunk by -1.25%. That sector had managed to keep growing in spite of the condition of the general economy, but it has now succumbed. It is a sector that employs a huge number of people, we must hope that this contraction is short. If not, many more jobs could be lost.</p>

<p>The positives are that Agriculture and solid mineral sectors have continued to grow, at 4.53% and 2.5% respectively, and their contribution to GDP has also increased. Hopefully, this continues.</p>

<p>Education, Electricity, Oil and Gas, Agriculture and Technology are critical issues that touch the life of every Nigerian fairly, either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>And of course, the favour of Almighty God on Niger-Delta region for situating the oil in the Niger-Delta is for a purpose that must not be turned into a curse. Mortals can only delay the purpose but cannot definitely abort the purpose.</p>

<p>Let us make the best use of the “new digital economy” golden opportunity, beckoning for the umpteenth time on us, the coming generations will remain eternally grateful for not allowing the opportunity to slip by, evident to this is the visit by the Facebook Founder, Mark Zuckerberg to Nigeria.</p>

<p>The summary of this is that right now, the bad news still outweighs the good news, and this should not be allowed to continue for long. Nigeria has too many unemployed people to be in a recession, and even the current situation was avoidable if the Presidency had heeded initial good advice. That advice is being heeded now, albeit belatedly and unevenly, and it will take time for the situation to improve.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/national-assembly-and-burden-debt-matters-arising-">National Assembly and the Burden of Debt: Matters Arising! - Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">August 26, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>The National Assembly management has said they are groaning over the harsh economic situation and weighed down by unbearable debt profile which has subjected them to serious suffering and almost pitched them against staff and contractors.</p>

<p>Contractors and suppliers are grumbling over the inability of the National Assembly management to liquidate the accumulated debts.</p>

<p>It was gathered that the situation has forced the management of the National Assembly to take cost cutting measures including the slashing down of salaries of legislative aides by about 70 percent.</p>

<p>A source familiar with the workings of the National Assembly told newsmen that the management is now taking inventory of the debt stock.</p>

<p>The source said some of the debts were incurred through contracts that might not have been executed. “It is a yearly occurrence,” the source added.</p>

<p>“There are huge debts, no doubt. They’re still in the process of compiling,” said the source.</p>

<p>One legislative aide said, “The situation is so worrisome that the new Clerk to the National Assembly, Alhaji Mohammed Sani-Omolori, has demanded for the comprehensive details of the debts profile.”</p>

<p>Asked about the major contracts being awarded by the National Assembly, the source said they included office facilities, vehicles, and maintenance.</p>

<p>“You’ll be shocked if you know the monumental corruption taking place in the management of the National Assembly. They change office equipment every year on paper, but you don’t get to see anything.”</p>

<p>“You can imagine even the maintenance being carried out by Julius Berger at the time was done on credit. It was because of the way they were going about the whole thing that Berger backed out from the contract of maintaining the NASS complex.”</p>

<p>“There are a lot of things my brother. Some of them would raise fake vouchers just to divert the money. Somebody would say he has travelled to somewhere, whereas he was in his house.”</p>

<p>“They also have ghost workers among the NASS staff, but because nobody probes them, people don’t get to know. With this kind of things, how do you expect the country to change?” said the source, who did not want to be named.</p>

<p>With several public outcries by active citizens for #OurNASS to #OpenNASS campaign, the National Assembly budget is still shrouded in secrecy despite repeated promises by the Senate President, Bukola Saraki to make the details public.</p>

<p>The budget of the National Assembly that was ₦23.3B in 2003 went up to as much as ₦150B for four years (2010 to 2013) but was slashed to ₦120B in 2014 and ₦115B in 2015 and 2016.</p>

<p>It is unimaginable that the National Assembly is broke, owning lawmakers and contractors in spite of the ₦115B budgetary allocations in the current year with all the unofficial padding here and there, chairman of this committee here and there.</p>

<p>If  the National Assembly management is really broke, then they should be strongly advised to start cutting their bogus allowances and begin to claim the 18,000 minimum wage standard, if majority of the people who elected the Senators and House of Representatives members to represent them are on 1-1- 0, 0-1-1 meal formula daily and can’t afford $1 per day or are being paid 18,000 wages and still being owed by their fellow public officers in the executive arm, why then the cry on the electorates?</p>

<p>Electorates did not elect the National Assembly members to become overnight billionaires but to make laws for the peace, order and good governance of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>

<p>They are expected to sit for 181 days in a year. How effective and efficient are they on the bills and motion sponsorship which is their primary role at the red and green chambers respectively?</p>

<p>All of the 109 Senators and 360 Honourables should carry out a self assessment!</p>

<p>Count the number of days they’ve spent since they were elected including the numbers of days on paid-recess and holidays, number of times they escorted the Senate President Bukola Saraki to CCB, the number of times they’ve engaged themselves in physical battles for leadership position, et al. In fact, NASS members should be paid pro rata simply…No work, No pay!!!</p>

    <p class="meta">August 22, 2016</p>

      <p>Certainly, Nigeria’s problems did not start with the adoption of the Presidential System of Government. And neither has the Presidential System of Government solved our problems. In retrospect the Presidential System of Government has created more problems for us leaving only the executives, legislators and their aides to operate the system.</p>

<p>On May 27, 1967, by virtue of state creation and Transitional Provision Decree 14 of 1967, General Yakubu Gowon created 12 states in the country – six from the old Northern Region, three from the old Eastern Region and three from the old Western Region. By Decree 39 of June 24, 1967, he created the Interim Common Services Agency to take over the assets of the old Northern Region and the Eastern States Interim Assets and Liabilities Agencies to take over the assets of the three states of Rivers, East Central State and South Eastern State.</p>

<p>There is another story elsewhere.</p>

<p>On Tuesday (January19, 2016), at the Cocoa House (Ibadan), the governors of the owner states of Oodua Investment Company met in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The current Chairman of the Oodua Investment Company, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, the governor of Ondo State announced that the company had invited Lagos State to join the company as the sixth shareholder of the conglomerate. At present, the company is owned by the governments of Oyo, Osun, Ogun, Ekiti and Ondo. Twenty four hours after the announcement, the governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode, accepted the invitation and declared his support for the growth of the company.</p>

<p>The company recorded a revenue growth of N4.2B last year as against N4.5B in 2013. The spokesman for Mimiko, Kayode Akinmade disclosed that the company targeted N20B asset base by 2019. He disclosed further that the proposed payment of gross dividend of N167M at its Annual General Meeting was approved and paid to all the owner states.</p>

<p>No doubt Oodua Investment Company has been a huge success and kudos must be given for those who have kept the flag flying for that company from 1976 till date, including premiers, sole administrators, governors (both civilian and military), in spite of their ideological and political differences.</p>

<p>Sadly, unlike the era of Awolowo, state governments of the old Western Region cannot pay salaries of workers now let alone establish industries and factories, a bad legacy of the present generation.</p>

<p>Nigeria is not structured to succeed. It is structured to perpetually continue to wobble and fumble (apologies to Mr. Fanny Amun, the football coach). Hope cannot help it. Good intentions cannot help it.</p>

<p>Many Nigerians have refused to come to this realisation and reality. No man – no matter how powerful and good-intentioned – has the capacity to get things working properly in all sections of Nigeria. It is like the biggest lion in the jungle trying to stop a cackle of hyenas from seizing its kill. As it charges at one hyena, other hyenas will swoop on the kill from another side. When the lion turns to that side to stop the hyenas, other hyenas will sneak in from another side and tear off some part of the kill. After exerting itself for a while, the lion will accept the fruitlessness in its action and abandon its kill for the hyenas and run away, to avoid getting hurt and becoming unable to hunt again. But it will be a different story if there are up to 10 lions feeding on the kill. The hyenas will only hang around, drooling and praying for some leftovers.</p>

<p> We either restructure this nation and move forward, or refuse to do so and remain with the age-long mediocrity and regression, comforting ourselves with the hope of a better tomorrow that a “good leader” will give us. It is our choice.</p>

    <p class="meta">August 12, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>Dogara (August 6, 2016):</p>

<hr />

<blockquote><p>I studied law; I have been a legislator… I have never heard the word 'padding' being an offence under any law</p>

<p>I am not Chairman of Ethics of the House, so I wouldn't know (if Jibrin will be sanctioned)</p></blockquote>

<p>Jibrin (August 7, 2016):</p>

<hr />

<blockquote><p>I have been consistent with the choice of the word 'insertions'</p>

<p>Even though the law allows it, I raised an observation that the insertions were being too much. The intention of the constitution is not for you to do senseless insertions</p>

<p>I know people will be asking me now, why didn't you raise it then? It's a difficult system and the institution is much more complex</p>

<p>I saw the number of insertions in 2011 (to 2015). In 2016, it went completely off the board</p>

<p>A couple of things need to add up to make it a crime</p>

<p>I wasn't part of the insertion</p>

<p>On 2 occasions, the Speaker directed that the appropriations secretariat be taken away from me</p>

<p>Psychologically, you are made to believe that when you are Chairman Finance... Chairman Appropriation, you are practically a custodian of secrets and there a lot of things you must not open up</p>

<p>Because we are talking of our own side does not mean there is no problem with the budget team or the budget office</p></blockquote>

<p>Ado-Doguwa (August 8, 2016):</p>

<hr />

<blockquote><p>When you are alledged to have committed what you have not committed, why should I be worried?</p>

<p>When you expect a legislator to work on a bill, he has the constitutional (supreme) right to deal with that bill at any level...  And at whatever level a legislator engages a budget (which is a bill...), he is doing nothing but his legitimate responsibility</p></blockquote>

<p>Daniel Reyenieju (August 8, 2016):</p>

<hr />

<p>There are certain criteria that make a Parliament very strong:</p>

<blockquote><p>A Parliament must be responsive</p>

<p>A Parliament must be accessible</p>

<p>A Parliament must be representative</p>

<p>A Parliament must be accountable</p>

<p>And a Parliament will demand accountability from its executive</p>

<p>And a Parliament that is… in immorality can hardly demand accountability from its executive</p>

<p>The Parliament belongs to the PEOPLE, it does not belong to the executive, it does not belong to the Judiciary, it does not equally belong to the Speaker, it belongs to the PEOPLE</p>

<p>That it (padding) has always been there doesn't make it right. That is breaching the trust that is being entrusted to you by the Nigerian people</p></blockquote>

      <p>In 1952, the Nigerian team made their first appearance and since then, Nigerian athletes have always participated in every tournaments of the summer Olympic games except for the 1976 Summer Olympic Games which held in Montreal due to the African boycott. Though, Nigeria has never participated in the Winter Olympic Games.</p>

<p>As usual, the Nigerian team was billed to compete at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro from August 5 to 21, 2016, however, not without controversy.</p>

<p>If we as a country with vast Human and material resources can't find a way to successfully manage and finance our team to the Olympic without late preparation, corruption and bribery, racketeering, drug performances and other demanding vices accompanied with the recent Olympic outing, how is the purpose of the outing to our Nation's corporate image (Internationally) going to be achieved? Actually, 'Olympism' is a way that "seeks to create a way of life based on the joy of effort, the educational value of good example, social responsibility and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles." Does this definition define our latest Olympic outing?</p>

<p>Disgraceful as it is, we heard about the case of the U-23 football team who were stranded in Atlanta and almost made us lose the opening match against Japan before Delta Airline came to the rescue, as if this isn't enough, another one rubbed our face and dent our global image as the much publicized new kit that was unveiled before President Buhari at the Aso Villa on the day Team Nigeria was officially handed over to the Nigeria Olympic Committee, NOC, failed to arrive Rio on time for the Opening Ceremony on Saturday. As a result of the non-arrival of their kits, Team Nigeria athletes had to march in tracksuits with one foreign journalist, Alexander Wolff of American Magazine, Sports Illustrated, taking to twitter to ridicule the country thus: “Nigeria, marching in sweats because official outfits didn’t make it to Rio. Can we agree that they’re a country to pull for these two weeks?”</p>

<p>The Youth and Sports Development Ministry was sent to the cleaners through social media outbursts from Nigerians as a result of the poor dressing. One of the quotes read “Shame on Nigeria. Shame! Shame! Shame! We are not capable of doing anything right. It is impossible to do the right thing. We are always coming up with stupid excuses that no one else seems to have. I could not find the right words to explain to my daughter here in Houston why we dressed like no other country. I was embarrassed. The opening ceremony was exciting until we appeared shamelessly and I did not need to be told that they left their official attire in Nigeria. We are ridiculous and shameless.” In truism, despite the near-exaggeration of the comments, they summarize the state of our nation and the depth at which corruption has eaten into our systems, in the comity of other countries, we still showcase our lackadaisical and obscure attitude to pressing international competition like the Olympic. This is utterly outrageous!</p>

<p>As various embarrassing happenings have continued to surge on Team Nigeria like a tsunami, the Nigerian Government (as usually said and not always done) promises to investigate the rot in the Olympic mess that brought international discomfort to the Nigerian team. Investigation isn't enough but bringing the culprits to book will go a long way in putting things in the normal way they should be.</p>

<p>Be it as it may, we equally call on the government to take swift actions to stem the tide and avoid future occurrence because we can't afford to have this crucial issue swept under the carpet as it is normally done in some other cases. If we can't get it right by organizing a shame-free Olympic outing, when and what can we get right as a country?</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/imo-state-back-land-agriculture-policy-matters-ari">Imo State Back to Land for Agriculture Policy, Matters Arising!!! – Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">August 5, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>The decline in the nation's economy has forced governments to look inwards and explore areas they have great strength and limitless advantage. This may be the reason why Governor Rochas Okorocha gave a paradigm shift and came out with a policy thrust on the ‘Back-to-Land for Agriculture’ policy of the state government which will enable public servants engage in agriculture as a way to be self-reliant. Governor Okorocha instructed public servants in the state to now work from Mondays to Wednesdays, and use Thursdays and Fridays for agriculture (farming) while Saturdays can be used for ceremonies. And the directive took effect from August 1, 2016.</p>

<p>There is no controversy in the life-saving opportunities in agriculture, especially in this sardonic economic recession period. Farming remains a fundamentally beneficial job for the individual and the society. When the food supply improves, the standard of life increases and cost of life reduces, but I have reservations in making civil service seem as if there isn’t much work to be done by civil servants. Private Multinational firm won't reduce the work days of his workers from the five days to three and expect the same productivity and outcome. The assumption that a large percentage of civil servants are part-time farmers and agricultural business owners, does not justify the reduction of their work days, and possible further decline in productivity.</p>

<p>We all know, the sum of ₦2 Billion was set aside for the program and it is already becoming a norm to have such money mismanaged in our clime through distribution of fertilizers and farm equipments which has always remained a racketeering business in Nigeria. Over the years, full-time farmers have had to lament the poor handling and mismanagement of the fertilizer distribution because past governments failed to destroy the racketeering scourge.</p>

<p>Responsively, in a bid to curb the racketeering syndicate in the distribution of fertilizers, the last administration introduced Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing Systems for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) which involves de-risk lending to the agricultural sector. It will be a great move for IMO state executive council to take from the portrait of this.</p>

<p>Importantly, I think the State Government would have been better placed if the Government massively invested in training and sensitization of the 'civil farmers' about Agricultural Science, economics, extension, harvesting, cropping, soil testing and other fundamentals, before kick starting the program. The sudden and furious commencement only mirrors the intention of the state government to supplement workers salary and give reasons if perhaps, in subsequent months, there occurs the inability to pay the workers 'Mondays - Wednesdays' salaries.</p>

<p>"Nemo dat quad non habet - You can't give what you don't have", non-farmers can't successfully practice farming without basic knowledge of the basics. And if we are relying on the crude and primitive farming ways for this program, indeed, something is wrong somewhere.</p>

<p>On another note, if teachers, nurses, doctors and those involved in Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) drive can be exempted from this policy and relieved of the farming rigors, what made other portfolios non-essential to get same exemptions? The state government needs to come bold on this and explain the reasons for the exemption so as not to send some core and relevant disciplines to the back seat owing to the 'Back to Land for Agriculture' policy.</p>

<p>To ensure that the objective of the program is met, I suggest the four core principles in executing the programmes.  The first principle hammers on the Agricultural training and empowerment to the civil farmers. The second approach is creating a synergy and strong partnership with the private sector, civil society, non-governmental organizations and particularly full-time farmers.  The third principle is to see farming as a worthy investment and endeavor so that the practitioners won't be psychologically dejected by the wretched lens we usually use in viewing farming. While the fourth borders on constant monitoring, evaluation, assessment and transparency on the part of the state government and the civil farmers.</p>

    <p class="meta">August 1, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has declared Ben Uwajumogu of the All Progressive Congress (APC) winner of Imo North Senatorial District rerun election held on July 28.</p>

<p>Mr. Uwajumogu scored 56,076 votes to defeat Athan Achonu of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who scored 43, 815 votes.</p>

<p>Arinze Agbogu, the INEC Returning Officer for Imo North Senatorial District, who announced the result in the early hours of Friday, said the outcome was a summation of scores of July 23 and that of July 28 exercise.</p>

<p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalled that Mr. Uwajumogu, had scored 48,921 on July 23, while Mr. Achonu of the PDP scored 40, 142 votes which made INEC to declare the rerun inconclusive.</p>

<p>Mr. Agbogu said available data before him showed that Mr. Uwajumogu had majority of lawful votes cast, and therefore returned elected for the Imo North Senatorial District.</p>

<p>Similarly, INEC declared Nkenna Nzeruo of the APC winner of Oru East State Constituency, while Collins Chiji also of APC was declared winner for Isiala Mbano State Constituency.</p>

<p>The two state constituencies' elections were equally declared inconclusive due to reported cases of violence that marred the exercise in some communities in the two areas on July 23.</p>

<p>Mr. Uwajumogu told journalists in Owerri that he was highly elated by the victory, adding "my gratitude goes more to Gov. Rochas Okorocha whose structure helped me to win this senatorial election''.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/budget-padding-speaker-dogara-and-sack-house-appro">Budget Padding, Speaker Dogara and the sack of House Appropriations Committee Chairman</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">July 28, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>There seems to be no end to the controversy surrounding the recent sack of Chairman of Appropriation Committee in the House of Representatives, Hon. Abdul Mumuni Jibrin.</p>

<p>This is because he has said that his refusal to support immunity for presiding officers as well refusal to approve the ₦40 billion for principal officers out of N100 billion approved for members of the House for constituency projects led to his removal.</p>

<p>Mr. Jibrin according to media reports said Speaker Dogara had repeatedly victimized him for being an independent voice in the lower chamber, saying he would work to ensure that the Speaker either resigns or is disgraced from office.</p>

<p>To achieve his aim, Mr. Jibrin said he would reveal to Nigerians all the corrupt practices involving Speaker Dogara, which he said were well documented.</p>

<p>In the latest media onslaught, Mr. Jibrin said the fraudulent tendencies of Speaker Dogara and some other House principal officers had become so pervasive that President Buhari would not hesitate to isolate and investigate them if he were to be briefed about them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, despite the growing demand from several quarters for the National Assembly to open its legislative proceedings and financial transactions to the citizenry for them to unravel the circumstances under which all these scandals were perpetrated, Speaker Dogara has maintained silence, saying he would rather allow the House to deal with the matter as an institution instead of engaging in political mudslinging with Mr. Jibrin.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that Mr. Jibrin was at the centre of allegations by House members during the 2016 budget exercise when it was alleged that the N60 billion earmarked for the Calabar–Lagos rail project was diverted to other projects leading to calls for his sack.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/njc-governor-aregbesola-and-sack-osun-judge-ishola">NJC, Governor Aregbesola and the sack of Osun Judge – Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">July 21, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>For daring to write a petition to the Osun state House of Assembly to commence impeachment proceedings of Governor Rauf Aregbesola and his deputy, Mrs Titilayo Laoye-Tomori for allegedly mismanaging the state’s resources, Justice‎ Olamide Folahanmi Oloyede of the High Court in the state has been recommended for compulsory retirement by the National Judicial Council (NJC).</p>

<p>The council under the lead¬ership of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Mahmud Mo¬hammed, took the decision at the end of its meeting last Friday. The NJC in its statement reads in part: “Justice Oloyede crossed the fundamental right of freedom of speech and created a negative perception of the Nigerian judiciary to the public. The allegations against the judge constitute misconduct contrary to Section 292(1) (b) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as amended and Rules 1(1) and 5 of the 2016 Revised Code of Conduct for Judicial Officers of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”</p>

<p>The call for the sacking of the judge began when the Osun Civil Societies Coalition petitioned the National Judicial Council, NJC, alleging that she over-stepped her limit as she failed to conduct herself in such a manner as to preserve the dignity of her office being an impartial and independent organ, thereby exposing the judiciary to ridicule and disrepute.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that the petition written by the judge in 2015 was said to contain political statements, unsubstantiated allegations and accusations aimed at deriding, demeaning and undermining the government of Osun State, the person and character of the governor (as one who is cruel, a liar and a traitor), his deputy and aides. The council also found that the petition contained statements calculated to incite the residents of Osun State against the state government and its elected officers.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/vice-president-yemi-osinbajo-and-call-state-polici">Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and the Call for State Policing: A Hope for New Nigeria – Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">July 15, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>Against the backdrop of Nigeria’s huge security challenge, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Tuesday gave his support for the introduction of state police. The vice president spoke through his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr. Laolou Akande in a radio programme monitored in Akure.</p>

<p>He said that the fear of abuse of the force by state governors, which critics had regularly held as part of the reasons for their opposition to the establishment of state police formations, remained untenable against the backdrop of the persisting allegations of the abuse of the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) by those who currently run and control it.</p>

<p>Well, I want to align with the thoughts of the Vice President. I believe that we are more than ripe for state police in today’s Nigeria. What is happening in Nigeria now demands not only the state police, but also local government police because in those days as far back as 1950s, we used to have the constabularies who were the local government police and they were very effective, dedicated. The question is where did we miss it? We missed it when the military decided to jettison the true federalism we inherited from our colonial masters and now replaced it with unitary system of governance.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t know how it will be possible for a Gbenga to be posted from Ogun State to Potiskum and you expect him to understand the social, cultural and religious sentiments of the people and be able to police them effectively. The same thing applies to a Paschal posted to Daura in Kastina or a Mohammed posted to River or Abia. This is just not normal if you are really practising true federalism. It should be such that the state should have their own security apparatus and manage it, given the realisation that it is the state governments that are actually funding the police.</p>

<p>The allocation to the police is usually mismanaged to the extent that nothing is provided for the police except their uniforms and monthly salaries. So, the kitting, the vehicles they use and other running costs are being shouldered by the state governments. What then stops us from decentralising it? In view of what is going on now in the country, anybody saying we are not ripe for the state policing must be absent-minded. And that is why the call for State Policing by Vice President Osinbajo is a sign of hope for a new Nigeria in the making.</p>

<p>Without mincing words, same over-centralisation is not only affecting the police, it is also affecting the Federal Civil Service whereby the issue of budget implementation becomes a problem. How do you expect a director or permanent secretary that sits down in Abuja to know what is going on in Imo or Delta? It is not just possible.</p>

<p>There can never be effective supervision. If you are to run an efficient government, whoever is employed in any particular local government should be made to start his career and end it there. The same applies for the state. Then at the federal level, as much as possible, most of what you call exclusive lists should be devolved in some of the states. Then let us eliminate those on the concurrent lists from the federal arrangement. Let it be exclusive for the states so that they will be able to do it most effectively.</p>

<p>Considering the state of insecurity in the country, if the police within a border town, say Ijebu, arrest someone for a criminal offence and it is supposed to be at the inter-change with Oyo, the normal thing is to hand the criminal over to the police in Oyo town, and if the crime committed is of national magnitude, then he should be handed over to the national police.</p>

<p>There is no problem without solution.  But running away from it is to keep postponing the evil day.  And we have postponed it now to the level where quality lives are being lost every day. It is very unfortunate we are where we are but hope is not totally lost for the country. State Policing is working in other climes, and if it is, there is no reason why it cannot work here in Nigeria.</p>

    <p class="meta">July 7, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>Ahead of the September 10, 2016 governorship election in Edo State, the Markafi-led Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) faction has picked a former local government chairman (Esan North East), Hon. John Yakubu, as running mate to its governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that the PDP had earlier zoned the position of the running mate of its governorship candidate to the Edo Central senatorial district.</p>

<p>Media reports confirmed that the governorship candidate of the party, Pastor Ize-Iyamu; Edo State chairman of the PDP, Dan Orbih and leaders of the party across the three senatorial districts of the state were also at the meeting where the decision was taken over the weekend in Benin at the residence of a former Chairman of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the PDP, Chief Tony Anenih.</p>

<p>It was also gathered that a consensus agreement was reached to pick Yakubu as running mate as majority of the leaders of the party endorsed his candidacy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ali Modu Sheriff faction of the PDP has vowed to submit the name of Matthew Iduoriyekwemwen to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as PDP candidate for Edo governorship election.</p>

<p>It is however hoped that the festering leadership crisis in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that has polarized the party between Senator Ahmed Makarfi and Senator Ali Modu Sheriff would suffice to make the party pass through it pains and troubles and make a viable alternative to the incumbent All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/federal-high-court-ikpeazu-and-tax-evasion-matters">Federal High Court, Ikpeazu and Tax Evasion: Matters Arising! – Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">June 29, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>Barely three months after the Supreme Court affirmed his election as Abia State governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu has been kicked out by the Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday. The Court ordered him to vacate office with immediate effect on the basis that he committed perjury by giving false information in the Form 8C001 and documents accompanying it, which he and the PDP submitted nominating him to INEC as the party’s governorship candidate.</p>

<p>In the judgment, Justice Okon Abang ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to issue a certificate of return to the plaintiff, Uche Ogah, who scored second highest number of votes during the PDP primary.</p>

<p>Similarly, one of the PDP governorship aspirants who filed a tax forgery suit against Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu, Sir Friday Nwosu, has faulted the judgment of the Federal High Court, stressing that he remained the rightful candidate of the party and that Dr. Samson Uchechukwu Ogah can’t be the governor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ikpeazu has filed an appeal against the Monday’s judgment of the Federal High Court in Abuja which removed him from ‎office as governor and asked the Appeal Court to set aside the judgment of Justice Okon Abang.</p>

<p>The Governor, in a notice of appeal filed by Chief Adegboyega Awomolo (SAN), raised five grounds of appeal upon which he asked the Court of Appeal to set aside the judgment and orders of the high court. Ikpeazu said that the Federal High Court lacked the power to order him to vacate his seat as Abia State Governor.</p>

<p>The notice of appeal reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>The trial judge erred in law when he ordered as a consequential order that the appellant vacates his office‎ as the Governor of Abia state immediately when there was no jurisdiction in the Federal High Court to remove, vacate the occupier of the office of the governor of a state or order the removal of such officer after the unsuccessful challenge of the result of the election at the Tribunal and swearing in of the appellant as the governor.</p></blockquote>

<p>The governor said that the only power, authority and order exercisable by the Federal High Court was to disqualify the candidate from contesting the election based on section 31(6) of the Electoral Act 2010.</p>

<p>Ikepazu also faulted the judge when he held that he did not pay his tax for 2011, 2012 and 2013 at when due when he was a public officer whose tax deduction was under Pay As You Earn (PAYE) scheme where tax deductions were made from the source of his monthly salary by the tax authorities, which issued all the tax receipts and certificates.</p>

<p>He also said the Abia State Board of Internal Revenue Services that issued him with the tax certificates had not declared the certificates forged and that the trial court did not invite the issuing authorities to give evidence in the course of the trial.</p>

<p>Ikpeazu said the plaintiff, Dr. Samson Uchechukwu Ogah, was not a staff of the Abia State Board of Internal Revenue and did not call any staff of the board to testify ‎that the tax certificates were forged.</p>

<p>He accused the trial judge, Justice Okon Abang, of violating his right to fair hearing by embarking on judicial investigation without giving him (Ikepazu) the opportunity to address the court on the issue.</p>

<p>Going by these political imbroglios arising from Abia State, one may pray that the Judiciary and INEC get it right before God’s Own State (Abia) is set on political fire.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/fgs-second-bail-out-states-pros-and-cons-ishola-ad">FG's Second Bail-Out for States: The Pros and Cons!!! - Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">June 23, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>At the assumption of this President Buhari-led federal government on 29 May 2015, 23 states were in arrears of salary payment of between two and 13 months, with Benue, Kogi, Osun and Cross River States reported to owe the highest number of months, while states like Ogun, Kogi, Ebonyi, Gombe, Plateau owed workers various deductions and pensioners’ stipends ranging from four and 16 months.</p>

<p>The Federal Government did not fare better. The former Minister of Finance and the Coordinating Minister for the Economy Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, few weeks before the expiration of the previous regime shocked Nigerians by informing the world that the Federal Government had been borrowing since January to pay civil servants as well.</p>

<p>The parlous state of the economy occasioned by dwindling oil receipts made the bailout inevitable. Little wonder the federal government had in July 2015 approved the sum of ₦804.7B as lifeline for states, to enable them pay their workers several months of arrears of salaries. The first 11 states that got their debts to commercial banks restructured were Osun, ₦88.6B; Delta, ₦69.8B; Ogun, ₦55.4B; Imo, ₦37.1B; Ekiti, ₦18.8B; Kwara, ₦15.6B; and Edo, ₦11.9B. Others were Benue, ₦10.9bn; Oyo, ₦9.1B; Bauchi, ₦6.5B and Kogi, ₦0.81B.</p>

<p> With a second bailout initiative in perspective, the Federal Government has spelt out fresh 22 stringent conditions Nigeria’s 36 states must fulfill to be eligible to draw from the ₦90B to bail out states facing severe financial difficulties, this surely has many economic implications on the economy at large, but some of these implications are negative. Most state governors and chairmen of councils have shown that they can’t be trusted with funds of their states and councils. They received of the first bailout funds, but what happened to those funds?</p>

<p>Corruption on the part of many state governors and the council chairmen was responsible for the inability to pay workers and pensioners because some states whose monthly federation allocation is low were able to manage such funds judiciously, while those with huge monthly allocations and high IGR are among states who owe workers for months.</p>

<p>States like Ondo, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Delta and others owe salaries for months or are huge debtors to local banks or contractors. A state like Delta currently owes ₦653B despite her monthly huge allocation from the federal government and high IGR.</p>

<p>If Delta state that collects one of the highest federal monthly allocation and said to have third highest IGR in the country could be owing workers and N635billion debt, then the state’s former governor like governors of many other oil producing states (such as Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, and Ondo) have much explanations to make to their people.</p>

<p>It’s a paradox that Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states which are the epicenter of the insurgents do not owe and still carry out some developmental projects. States like Sokoto, Katsina, and some states in the north which receive the lowest federal monthly allocations also do not owe workers. However, oil producing states and states in the South West (the most peaceful zone) owe workers for several months. This is difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Between 2011 up till when the last administration left in May of 2015, the country earned about $315B from crude oil sales alone. Other revenue sources were not included; so to now find ourselves in a situation where the country is unable to pay its few civil servants is unthinkable.</p>

<p>Until the anti graft agencies are able to tackle corruption at the various levels, would the state governments continue to cry to the Federal Government for a bailout. The governors and council bosses who collected their allocations and the first tranche of the bailout funds and failed to pay workers cannot be trusted to manage this second bailout judiciously.</p>

<p>As the federal government goes ahead with the planned second bailout,  with an expectation to reduce the number of Nigerians who daily commit suicide, it is hoped that states governments will develop the agricultural sector in their domain as well so as to reduce corrupt practices which have made many states poor.</p>

<p>It is essential that the anti graft agencies bring to book corrupt political office holders. This is in respect to the reality that most states who owe workers and are contending with huge debts had their resources looted by governors and other political office holders.</p>

<p>I will also expect EFCC to prosecute the former Imo, Jigawa, Adamawa and other former governors standing trial to enable the states who are unable to pay salaries or in huge debt to have their funds returned to enable them meet peoples’ expectations.</p>

<p>The months ahead will show if the states utilized this second bailout and loan facility judiciously or are looted as was the case in the past. It is hoped that labour leaders and top civil servants who were alleged to assist politicians to loot funds of their states and local governments must have learnt from the salary and pension debts which almost crippled economic development of several states and councils. Questions arise:</p>

<p>Are they ready to do this?</p>

<p>Is the easy money called ‘bailout funds from Abuja’ not actually a disincentive to creative thinking by most States Governors?</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/8th-nass-after-1-year-top-ten-highlightscontrovers">8th NASS after 1 year - Top Ten Controversies & Stats - O.S.A. Aluko</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">June 17, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <ul>
<li><strong>Principal Positions, Juicy Committees &amp; Exotic Cars:</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>The Senate and House of Reps were rocked with controversy as regard filling leadership positions – Senate Presidency, House Speakership, their deputies and principal officers. Consequently, when it came to chairmanship of committees, some discontented committee chairmen actually resigned from their appointment to ‘non-juicy’ committees.</p>

<p>Next in line was the purchase of cars. The Senate reportedly splashed ₦4.7B on the procurement of Toyota Land Cruisers Sport Utility Vehicles for 109 members. While the House of Representatives budgeted ₦3.6B, but went for ‘Naija-made’, actually Naija-assembled Peugeot 508 Salon cars for 360 members.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>OpenNASS:</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>The National Assembly’s budget for 2016 was released to the public as ₦115B. However, there was no element of detail as to what the money was intended for. Numerous times, SP Saraki promised and failed to make the details public. Once again, in the process of marking this anniversary, he said:</p>

<p>‘We have directed that the breakdown of the national assembly budget be posted on our website. It will not be business as usual.‎”</p>

<p>We wait to see!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Frivolous Petitions Bill (Anti-Social Media Bill):</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>This is arguably the most controversially vexing of all occurrences at the 8th NASS so far. It was a bid to regulate citizen’s free use of social media. Following lashings, newspaper articles, media rants and law suits, the proposed bill was withdrawn by its sponsor, Senator Bala Ibn Na’Allah.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ministerial Screening &amp; Appropriation Bill:</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>More than ever before, young Nigerian citizens paid attention to the screening process of ministerial nominees. But it was rather disappointing as the lawmakers’ performance was far from being thorough.</p>

<p>Consequently, the budget proposal was presented to NASS in December 2015. The original budget size was ₦6.08T. It went down to ₦6.07T and eventually came out as ₦6.06T. Following 4 months of drama and accusations the budget was passed in April, and signed by the president in May.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Grazing Bill:</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Following series of violent attacks by herdsmen on farmers in the middle belt, there were reports that NASS was considering passing a bill to mandate allocation of land in all states for Fulani herdsmen. The resulting outcry led to lawmakers denying the existence of any such bill. However, 13 northern states have now voluntarily contributed land portions for grazing purposes.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SP Saraki's trial at CCB:</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Mixed with many politicizing, controversies and delays, the Senate president’s trial at the Code of Conduct Tribunal continues. Watch out for the next season.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Attempt to amend CCB/CCT Act:</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Seeming like a bid to favour SP Saraki in the trial at CCT, the Nigerian Senate being presided by VSP Ekweremadu sought to amend the CCB/CCT Act. Citizens were quick to blast them; hence, the move was stopped by the Senate. However, the same bill was amended by the federal Reps a week later with the introduction of 10 new provisions.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Kogi Assembly Take Over:</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>In line with the provisions of Section 11 (4) of the 1999 Constitution, the House of Reps took over the Kogi State House of Assembly following unresolved conflicts among the elected state lawmakers. Nevertheless, both the state governor and the federal minister of justice questioned the legality of the take-over. Federal reps have accused the governor of encouraging five out of the 25-member legislature to continue to sit in spite of the said take-over.</p>

<p>The governor has been summoned to appear before a panel chaired by majority leader, Femi Gbajabiamila. The House said it derived its powers to summon the governor under sections 88/89 of the constitution. This has been somewhat questioned as well. Question is – will Governor Bello appear before the panel? If he doesn’t, what will the reps do?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>E-Parliament &amp; Constitution Review:</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>The House of Representatives has emerged the first of the 2 chambers to respond to citizens’ call for an e-parliament. We still wait on the Senate. Nevertheless, the latter has done well to livetweet plenary proceedings and last week made a commitment to live streaming.</p>

<p>On another major note, after much lingering, the constitution amendment process is back on track. The ad-hoc committees in the two chambers are chaired by DSP Ekweremadu and DS Lasun.</p>

<blockquote><p>We must conclude the amendment by the end of the year... Let us amend the areas we all agreed on because we may not agree on all the issues…</p></blockquote>

<p>– SP Saraki</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Electoral Act &amp; #NotTooYoungtoRun:</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Hon. Nwulu is probably the most popular lawmaker among Nigerian youths right now. He is presently pushing for the reduction the age qualification for the office of president from 40 to 30 years, office of Governor from 35 to 30 years, Senate from 35 to 30 years and State Houses of Assembly from 30 to 25 years.</p>

<p>In the same vein, a bill to amend the electoral act has been referred to the Ad hoc Committee for constitutional review chaired by DS Lasun. This includes the possibility of granting the request of Nigerians in Diaspora to be allowed to participate in general elections.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/undetailed-budget-national-assembly-nigerians-wait">Undetailed Budget of the National Assembly: Nigerians wait on!!! - Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">June 15, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>Despite repeated assurances by the leadership of the National Assembly that it would ensure transparency in the management of the Assembly, the details of the 2016 budget of the federal legislature in the 2016 National budget is yet to be made public to Nigerians.</p>

<p>In the budget President Muhammadu Buhari assented to for both the Senate and House of Representatives on May 6th 2016, the sum of N115 billion was allocated to the National Assembly without a breakdown.</p>

<p>One of the areas Nigerians have been trying to engage the National Assembly to ensure openness and transparency is the details of their bogus budget. This is because since the commencement of the current democratic dispensation, the budget of the National Assembly has consistently been shrouded in secrecy.</p>

<p>At best, the only thing Nigerians get to hear is the amount allocated to the National Assembly; nothing is revealed about the budget breakdown. This is where the concerns stem, to the extent that the payment of the salaries and allowances of the lawmakers are drawn from the first line charge or the consolidated revenue fund of the federation.</p>

<p>Though, the National Assembly budget covers the salaries and allowances of the entire bureaucracy that make up the parliament, including the National Assembly Service Commission, the National Institute for Legislative Studies (NILS), budget office of the National Assembly as well as the legislative aides and ironically some spurious allocations to the lawmakers.</p>

<p>Like the case of the executive and the judiciary, Nigerians would want to know how the allocation to the National Assembly is shared among the various competing sectors and departments of the National Assembly.</p>

<p>Nigerians are interested in knowing for instance how much was allocated for the maintenance of the assembly grasses and flowers, how much was allocated for the purchase of cars for the lawmakers and the bureaucrats, how much was allocated for travels and trainings, how much was allocated for the purchase of computers, how much was allocated for repainting of the buildings, how much was allocated for maintaining security at the complex and so on and so on.</p>

<p>This is not asking for too much. After all, such details as the cost of providing food and entertainment for the Presidential Villa were made public by the lawmakers themselves during the last budget defense.</p>

<p>The point we are making here while Nigerians wait on is that the National Assembly, like the executive and the judiciary must come clean on its budget in line with the “change” mantra of the present administration and the pledge of the Senate President, Bukola Saraki.</p>

<p>If the details of National Assembly budget cannot be published during this All Progressives Congress (APC) administration of “change” and anti-corruption, then when would it? Would Nigerians ever know what the National Assembly does with the N115bn allocated to it in the 2016 national budget?</p>

    <p class="meta">June 10, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>Ambassadors are direct representatives of a nation's president in another country. In Nigeria, the power to appoint or to remove ambassadors is vested in the President. However, any such appointment shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by the Senate.</p>

<p>In 2011, an ambassadorial nominee was asked to recite the national anthem and the national pledge. She failed. She also did not know the capital of Jigawa State. Nevertheless the woman was endorsed and confirmed by the Senate. Consequently, she was part of the 93 envoys posted out in 2012.</p>

<p>Consequent to the start of the new administration in 2015, a number of ambassadors on tour of duty abroad were recalled. 12 months after, the Senate receives a list of 47 ambassadorial nominees from President Buhari.</p>

<p>More than ever before, the Senate needs to do a thorough, but quick job on screening this set of ambassadorial nominees. Only competent officials should represent our nation in other countries. We need to get it right this time, and not 4 years later. You should ask your Senator how he/she intends to ensure effective screening of the following ambassadorial nominees:</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/blasphemy-killing-kano-state-and-sharia-law-matter">Blasphemy Killing in Kano State and the Sharia Law: Matters Arising! - Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">June 8, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>After Nigeria's return to civil rule in 1999, Muslim majority states in the north imposed Sharia law.  The process was marked by bloody clashes between Muslims and Christians in states with significant number of non Muslims like in Kaduna and Bauchi, many lives were lost.</p>

<p>Many people were displaced and property destroyed. At the end of the day, Sharia ruled -fully or partially- in many of the states. Right now the situation remains volatile. Tension and unease calm reign across the region. Hatred, division and suspicion caused by the introduction of Sharia law is not going away too soon.</p>

<p>At the beginning of Sharia implementation, governments in these states assured the people that the law would not apply to non Muslims; that the law was for Muslims only. But this is not the case today.</p>

<p>Most Sharia implementing states have become fully fledged Islamic states where non Muslims are treated as second class citizens. In fact many Sharia implementing states have made Islam a state religion and promotion of Islam a state business.</p>

<p> Of major concern however, is the unfortunate news that one Mrs. Agbahime Bridget was killed last week Thursday by a mob in Kano State after she was accused of blasphemy. The Kofar Wambai market woman would have been sentenced to death by beheading anyway had she been arrested by Kano’s Islamic police and tried by the state’s Sharia court. But the apparently religious mob that found her guilty of soiling the name of Islam’s holy prophet was obviously too enraged for the process of law.</p>

<p>More recently in January 2016, a Kano upper Sharia Court sentenced one Abdulaziz Dauda, popularly known as Abdul Inyass, to death by hanging for allegedly insulting Prophet Mohammed. The accused is appealing the verdict.</p>

<p>Bridget was not afforded that luxury last Thursday evening. Instead of committing Bridget to ‘their own’ Sharia law which Nigeria had unbelievably added to its “secular” constitution, the angry mob allegedly took hold of the woman and beat her to death. This reportedly happened while the woman’s husband watched on in despair and helplessness.</p>

<p>The woman’s death is re-igniting the debate over whether or not Nigeria should expand the reach of Sharia Law to every state in the country. Abdullahi Salame, the APC House of Rep member behind a bill to expand Sharia Law nationwide says the move would protect the Christians. If Sharia law is not expanded, Islamic extremists who attack Christians won’t find a legal deterrent, the rep stated in media reports.</p>

<p>In Nigeria, Sharia has been instituted as a main body of civil and criminal law in 9 Muslim-majority states and in some parts of 3 Muslim-plurality states since 1999. Kano state instituted Sharia courts and customary courts on June 21, 2001. Eight other northern states instituted the same since 1999. The move began with the then Zamfara State governor Ahmad Sani Yerima who began the push for the institution of Sharia at the state level of government in 1999.</p>

<p>Under Sharia law, women are flogged or even beheaded for committing adultery, and thieves are amputated. But Islamic scholars say the law applies only to Muslims.</p>

<p>The time has come for Sharia implementing states to call their flocks to order. They need to divest from state funding of Sharia and invest in building schools, colleges and skill acquisition centers. Sharia states should invest in schemes that create jobs, tackle poverty and empower the people; schemes that address the development needs of persons of all faiths and none.</p>

<p> Sharia implementing states should check the activities of Hisbah and other quasi Sharia policing organs in the region. These groups are spreading Islam-based hatred, fear and intolerance. If as they say, there is no compulsion in Islam, then there is no need for Sharia police at least in indigent Muslim majority states in northern Nigeria.</p>

<p>Sharia agitators declared in 1999 that the destiny and development of Muslim majority states was tied to Sharia implementation. Going by these recent developments in northern Nigeria, one may ask: Is Sharia implementation desirable in today’s Nigeria?</p>

<p>Beyond doubt, Senator Buruji Kashamu <a href="http://www.shineyoureye.org/person/buruji-kashamu/" title="Senator Buruji Kashamu">Senator Buruji Kashamu</a> appeared at the Magistsrate Court in Isabo, Abeokuta. Based on rumors, over 100 awaiting citizens flooded the court premises, not for interest in the court case, but for the expected Naira rain by the famous money-bag. Immediately the Ogun-East senator stepped into the court room, he was called up as a complainant to open a case against Deji Babington-Ashaye.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Senator was seeing the defendant for the first time and to his surprise, it was only a ‘young man’. In response to the judge’s call, the senator said that having now realized that he had been in a legal tussle with a young man, with whom he had no business; he would gladly withdraw the suit.</p>

<p>The case was struck out. And surely, the Naira rains began as the senator stepped out.</p>

<p>Following enquiries from the defence lawyer, Barr. Umoh, the following were revealed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The person who allegedly made defamatory statements on the Whatsapp platform is different from who was sued</p></li>
<li><p>This is most likely as a result of ‘beef’ on the part of the senator’s media aide</p></li>
<li><p>Even the aide, on the same chat, used defamatory remarks on another senator of the federal republic.</p></li>
</ul>

    <p class="meta">June 2, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>A drizzle greeted constituents as they poured in to Mercy Hall on CMD Road, Magodo. From the gate, police men give directions to a 50m by 30m hall. Right inside, two things stand out, women in geles singing in Yoruba with passion, and ‘empowerment’ tools which filled up to one-fifth of the hall. The latter included cartons of Indomie noodles, cartons of Power oil, hair dryers, as well as mini gas cookers well branded with the senator’s photo and name.</p>

<p><img src="/media_root/file_archive/1_PEJmazx.jpg" title="LagosEastTHM2016a" alt="LagosEastTHM2016a" /></p>

<p>The women’s continue to sing as ‘honourables’ are called to the high table. Consequently, the Oba of Ketu is ushered into the hall and straight to the table. Right about that time, the ‘Youth Leader’ is called up. The women began to sing:</p>

<p><img src="/media_root/file_archive/2_aChhGyV.jpg" title="LagosEastTHM2016b" alt="LagosEastTHM2016b" /></p>

<p>“Eje ki omode ko wa… Jojolo, omokekere jojolo…”</p>

<p>A song purposed for Yoruba children aged 10 years and thereabout. Ironically, the “Youth Leader” looks well over 40.</p>

<p>In order to move on, the constituents urged the women to keep quiet for the opening prayer. Immediately, it was time to say the National Prayer. But some way, somehow, it was just the 1st stanza of the National Anthem that was sung.</p>

<p><img src="/media_root/file_archive/3_52Bg5gi.jpg" title="LagosEastTHM2016c" alt="LagosEastTHM2016c" /></p>

<p>Finally, it was time for Senator Ashafa to address the people. Firstly, he couldn’t help but show a sign of being fed up with the women’s over-singing stunts. He repeatedly stressed “Ese pupo o, ese…”.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/finally-house-reps-opennass-e-voting-system">Finally! House Reps #OpenNASS with E-voting system - Ishola Adebayo</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">June 1, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>Media reports last week confirm that Hon. Yakubu Dogara, Speaker of the House of Representatives, has introduced electronic voting system for use in all legislative proceedings in the lower chamber of the National Assembly.</p>

<p>At the moment, voting in the House is done via a primitive - all in support say ‘Aye’, all who are against, say ‘nay’ - system, which is as opaque as opaque gets, and is generally a very inefficient way to do things in this 21st century.</p>

<p>Before now, there have been several campaigns on #OpenNASS directing the National Assembly to make its votes and proceedings on key national issues known to the public especially as it relates the National Budget, Gender Equality Bill, Cyber Crime Bill, among others.</p>

<p>As expected, Electronic voting system can include punched cards, optical scan voting systems and specialized voting kiosks including self-contained direct-recording electronic voting systems. It can also involve transmission of ballots and votes via telephones, private computer networks, or the Internet.</p>

<p>The implication of this new system is that records of each member’s punctuality and voting patterns can easily be accessed by his or her constituents and members of the public. But knowing our fantastic country,  we wouldn’t be surprised one bit if a bloated contract is awarded for the e-parliament – as they’ve described it – and a few months later, we start hearing excuses like “the server is down”, when a request is made for their voting data.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, E-voting has been achieved. Check. Next stop, we reinstate our demand that the breakdown of the 2016 National Assembly Budget be made public.</p>

    <p class="meta">April 22, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>After 7 years of running the Ondo State Government, the Governor Mimiko-led administration will conduct its first election for aspiring local government chairmen. The exercise billed for <strong>April 23 (tomorrow)</strong> happens to be just about 7 months before the end of the governor's tenure.</p>

<p>In response, at least 2 major political parties have opted to boycott the election - the All progressives Congress (APC) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The aggrieved parties plan to direct all their efforts towards the battle for the gubernatorial seat later in November this year.</p>

<p>Never the less, the importance of this electoral exercise cannot be overemphasized. It is another opportunity for the locals to reactivate their citizenship. This is a process that will determine who leads each of the 18 local government areas for the next 4 years. In essence, public funds will be committed to this 18 men and/or women. These 18 beings will decide the mode and level of development and progress of each local government area for the 4 years. This is greatly important.</p>

<p>To ensure that the exercise turns out a success, the Ondo State Commissioner of Police (Hilda Ibifuro-Harrisson) has deployed over <strong>6000 Police officers</strong> to ensure order in each local government area. This is in addition to the <strong>7000 ad-hoc staff</strong> already trained by the Ondo State Independent Electoral Commission.</p>

<p>All is set. Kick-off is less than 24 hours. Residents in Ondo's 18 LGAs have the <strong>priviledge to choose from 17 political parties</strong>. This is a decision they must make themselves. May the people win!</p>

    <p class="meta">April 21, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>The Magistrate Court in Isabo, Abeokuta on Wednesday, 13th April, 2016 at 11:05am commenced hearing on the arraigned "social media activist" named Deji Babington-Asaye for calling Buruji Kashamu, the Senator representing Ogun East, a "drug baron and jail breaker".</p>

<p>The court said, Mr. Babington-Asaye, a member of the People's Democratic Party (PDP), made the comment on a PDP WhatsApp group chat between March 12th and 13th, 2016.</p>

<p>The Prosecuting Counsel, asked the Court to strike out the old charges (libel and slander) and presented a new charge/accuse of breach of public peace and threatening the life of Buruji Kashamu.</p>

<p>However, the defense counsel, Tayo Amowo, asked the court to grant his client bail.</p>

<p>The Complainant Counsel objected the defense counsel request and asked the Court not to grant the accused person bail henceforth or the Court place a stringent bail condition on the accused person for him not to abscond and must always appear in court.</p>

<p>The Chief Magistrate thereafter granted Mr. Babington-Asaye bail in the sum of #250,000 and two surety with evidence of 2015 tax clearance to the Ogun State Government.</p>

<p>The Court ordered that the complainant, Senator Buruji Kashamu appear at the next court hearing and then adjourned the matter till Friday, 29th of April, 2016.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that Mr. Kashamu was the mastermind behind an extensive drug trafficking ring based in Chicago, USA. He is currently wanted by the United States Department of Justice for smuggling heroin and other narcotics into the USA through O’Hare International Airport in Chicago. Mr. Kashamu's elaborate drug operation was in part featured in the American TV series Orange Is The New Black.</p>

    <div>
      <p>The 2016 FCT Local Council elections finally came to conclusion following rerun polls on Wednesday (April 13, 2016).</p>

<p>In the rerun, the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) broke the northern nigeria jinx, by attaining a first victory ever in the region. This was made possible by Adamu Mustapha 's victory in Gwagwalada local government area.</p>

<p>Generally, the 'governing party', APC, overshadowed the PDP by winning all five of the other local government areas.</p>

<p>The FCT Local Council election winners are as follows:</p>

<p>Municipal - Ibrahim Adamu Candido (APC)</p>

<p>Kuje - Abdullahi Galadima (APC)</p>

<p>Kwali - Joseph Shazih (APC)</p>

<p>Bwari - Musa Dikko (APC)</p>

<p>Abaji - Abdulrahman Ajiya (APC)</p>

<p>Gwagwalada - Adamu Mustapha (APGA)</p>

    <p class="meta">April 12, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>The FCT Area Council poll was logically expected in some quarters to entail a low turnout of voters. The reason was because just about 55% of 1 million registered voters picked up their PVCs. This expectation was well proven on the day, as far from many voters participated in the electoral process.</p>

<p>Following the exercise on Saturday, the INEC declared results for only 2 of 6 local council areas – Bwari and Kwali. APC's Joseph Shazin was declared winner of the polls in Kwali, while APC’s Musa Dikko emerged victorious in Bwari.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as a result of perceived occurrences of violence and nonuse of smart cards, elections were declared inconclusive in 4 area councils – Abaji, Gwagwalada, Kuje and Municipal. According to INEC, the decision was based on the fact that the number of cancelled votes was more than the votes separating the leading candidates.</p>

<p>The Independent National electoral Commission has scheduled a rerun to take place in 39 polling units, spread across the 4 council areas in question.</p>

<p>The new election date is April 13 (tomorrow).</p>

<p>Accreditation and voting processes are set to kick-start simultaneously at 8am.</p>

    <p class="meta">March 18, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>March 17, 2016.</p>

<p>At 10:50am, Blue Roof Event Centre was filled with the echo “APC! APC! APC”!</p>

<p>Right about the same time, <a href="http://www.shineyoureye.org/person/solomon-olamilekan-adeola/" title="Senator Adeola">Senator Adeola</a> (AKA Yayi), 50 minutes late, was squeezed in by black-vested bodyguards, as his employees (constituents) stood in ovation seeking to, if possible, look through the numerous geles.</p>

<p><img src="/media_root/file_archive/1_kexu9g6.jpg" title="LagosWestTHMMarch2016" alt="LagosWestTHMMarch2016" /></p>

<p> Right after the national anthem was sung in a patriotic manner, ‘elderly’ constituents scrambled for the Senator’s publication in a manner younger men would find it hard to compete with.</p>

<p><img src="/media_root/file_archive/2_Xe1lDem.jpg" title="LagosWestTHMMarch2016" alt="LagosWestTHMMarch2016" /></p>

<p>And when it was time for the senator to deliver his report to his employers, the same time goody bags were being distributed, a good number of the constituents made sure to go for what was priority – scramble for goody bags!</p>

<p><img src="/media_root/file_archive/4_Jp4UP9z.jpg" title="LagosWestTHMMarch2016" alt="LagosWestTHMMarch2016" /></p>

<p>Senator Solomon Adeola Olamilekan made sure to give recognition to Obas, Baales and Imams. More like in a bid to make up for allowing only a muslim opening prayer, he began to sing “I have decided to follow Jesus, I have decided… “.</p>

<p>Eventually, the speech commenced after the prolonged session of recognition.</p>

<p>Firstly he explained that the Townhall Meeting was delayed due to the leadership tussle in the National Assembly. How? One may ask. But he did not bother to expatiate. Nevertheless, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that a member of the opposition party emerged as Vice Senate President.</p>

<p>According to Senator Yayi, over 50 resolutions and over 75 motions have been presented so far on the floor of the Senate. He went on to say “We have sufficient laws. Instead of making new laws, we aim to correct anomalies in them”.</p>

<p>As regards his personal achievement, he emphasized the successful petition for Sergeant Olaniyan who was unjustly removed from service in the Police Force many years ago.</p>

<blockquote><p>I urge all of you with similar cases of administrative injustice to submit your petition to my office in Abuja or my constituency office in 32 Adeniyi Jones</p></blockquote>

<p>– Senator Olamilekan</p>

<p>He continued by outlining his contribution to the Senate’s Legislative Agenda and his membership of committees. The Lagos West Senator is the Vice president of the Communications committee and a member of Finance, Science &amp; Technology, Banking, Interior and Marine Committees in the Nigerian Senate.</p>

<p>Right after the Senator’s report, it was supposed to be time for ‘questions’ i.e. ENGAGEMENT.</p>

<p>On the contrary, constituents had other plans. Unbelievably, they crowded the stage and, in effect, disrupted proceedings.</p>

<p>Alas, Senator Yayi, after much pleading in vain, opted to move on to the handing over of transformers, sewing machines, vulcanizing machines, welding machines, tricycles, buses and scholarship cheques.</p>

<p>Even the Senator said “I am open to your suggestions”! The constituents missed a great opportunity to ask pertinent questions. How did he vote, on their behalf, in regards to the <a href="/media_root/file_archive/2015_GEO_BILL.pdf" title="GEO Bill">GEO Bill</a>? As Vice Chairman of the Communications Committee, what is his stand  on the <a href="/media_root/file_archive/Frivolous_Petitions_Bill.pdf" title="Anti-Social Media Bill">Anti-Social Media Bill</a>?</p>

<p>It appears Senator Yayi was honest when he said to the Obas:</p>

<blockquote><p>I will always be there for you, always speak your mind, and always say those things that will make you happy on the floor of the Senate</p></blockquote>

<p>But there wasn’t such a commitment to the true employers - the people. Who else will make voters in Lagos West Senatorial District happy?</p>

<p>The Nigerian Senate on Tuesday, 15th of March, 2016 voted against the Gender and Equal Opportunity (GEO) Bill. The bill could not pass the second reading after the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, put the bill to vote with the “Nays” having it.</p>

<p>The GEO Bill seeks adoption of special temporary measures to eliminate discrimination and ensure equal opportunities for majority of Nigerians, while it also seeks appropriate measures against gender discrimination in political and public life and prohibitions of violence to women.</p>

<p>Although, there have been controversies about the GEO Bill and the recent decision by the federal lawmakers have just sparked up another social media outcry as it will limit the female gender.</p>

<p>The questions on the lips of many Nigerians - How can one explain to people that our lawmakers shut down Gender and Equality Bill using ‘Aye’ and ‘Nay’ votes only? What happened to electronic voting in the 21st Century?</p>

<p>No doubt, this could easily affect the fundamental human right in the country and might dent the chances to prevent violence against women leading to more cases like Ese Orurus’.</p>

<p>Nigerian citizens in their various constituencies always wonder where the opinions and ideas their legislators’ present in the National Assembly originate from when they barely hold meetings with their constituents to discuss relevant issues.</p>

<p>In addition, the electorate have always complained that their elected lawmakers appear in their constituencies to only solicit for votes in the run-up to elections and disappear shortly afterwards, without ever meeting the people during their tenure in office.</p>

<p>Alas! This cannot be said of Senator Oluremi Tinubu who represents Lagos Central Senatorial District in the Senate. She has consistently provided the platform for her constituents to engage with her at the regular town hall meetings which have been a feedback mechanism aimed at promoting transparency and accountability.</p>

<p>The town hall meeting which was the 17th in the series of interactive town hall meetings by the senator since her inauguration, tagged: From Dreams to Reality – A Call to Duty, held on Thursday, 10th March 2016 at the Eko Club in Surulere, Lagos State.</p>

<p>The meeting which had the senator's political party members in attendance would have been a good avenue for active citizens to engage her about the raging NoToSocialMediaBill, the demand for #OpenNASS, among many other topical national issues that directly concern Nigerians.</p>

<p>Disappointingly, besides a representative of EiE-Nigeria at the forum, there was no record of any constituents engaging the senator at the meeting. Out of over 5 million residents in Lagos Central Senatorial District, not a single person demanded a progress report of the senator's various bills sponsored in the 8th National Assembly.</p>

<p>The Office of the Citizen requires citizens to play their part in this democratic process by holding elected officials accountable.</p>

<p>Well, residents of Lagos West Senatorial District have their opportunity to engage Senator Solomon Adeola Yayi when holds his first town hall meeting scheduled to hold on Thursday, March 17, 2016at the BlueRoof, LTV 8, Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos by 10am prompt.</p>

<p>Will you be there?</p>

      <p>Speaker, House of Representatives, Mr. Yakubu Dogara, has solicited the support of the British parliament in establishing Radio and Television stations for the National Assembly.</p>

<p>Dogara noted that the establishment of the media outfits in the parliament would enable Nigerians to access and assess activities of their elected representatives as the stations, when established, will transmit proceedings live from the two chambers.</p>

<p>The Speaker said the media stations were in line with the legislative agenda of the 8th National Assembly and its commitment to encourage citizen participation in governance.</p>

<p>Dogara who said these when he received members of the International Development Committee of United Kingdom’s Parliament in his office on last week Thursday, also disclosed that the House of Reps had set up the Nigeria-British Parliamentary Friendship Group as part of measures  to strengthen the relationship between the two parliaments.</p>

<p>The Speaker also told the UK Lawmakers that the House of Representatives had begun the process of amending over 130 laws of the country to meet the contemporary realities of governance with the support of the Department For International Development (DFID).</p>

    <div>
      <p>Shall we start with a lesson in Democracy 101? It was in Athens in Greece that what we now regard as Democracy first took shape. Truth however is African philosophy records elements of Democracy in Ancient Egypt 3000 years before the birth of Jesus, but History is for another day. The word parliament took its essential root also in Athenian Democracy where it was called ekklesia and was the most important institution of that system and every citizen could take part in the discussions.</p>

<p>Athenian democracy was not representative and this meant every adult male could participate and that differentiated it from the parliamentary system. Essentially, these assemblies had the FINAL SAY when it came to matters of elections, enactment of new statutes, prescription of punishments, declaration of war and peace, creation of alliances and every matter bordering around money, administration and foreign policy.</p>

<p>The history of any prosperous society can be traced more or less to its parliament. Every society that has emerged from third world into first world has had to rely on the representatives of the people come together to make their lives better through policies, rules and bills. Let me make this simpler. You cannot make a society better without the active input of its parliament. Ironically, a lot of our advocacy and civil society focus has been on the federal government and the state governments while we neglect the supposed representatives both at the national assemblies and the state assemblies.</p>

<p>Barack Obama’s first tenure is a good example of how the parliament is the tool for CHANGE. Whenever his achievements are detailed and indeed any successful President, the items mentioned are usually in the form of bills and acts that more often than not affect the lives of people directly. Let’s consider Wikipedia’s profile of Barack Obama.</p>

<blockquote><p>During his first two years in office, Obama signed into law economic stimulus legislation in response to the Great Recession in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Other major domestic initiatives in his first term included the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as ‘Obamacare’; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act of 2010.</p></blockquote>

<p>It’s not about magic nor is it about miracles. Issues that affect the average wo/man in society are issues that are tied to bills and laws which when passed are bound to improve the life of that average wo/man.</p>

<p>Take any Nigerian politician and ask him what he has achieved since office and he will tell you about the schools he built or the markets he constructed or the roads he patched, including Legislators. It is quite true that Nigeria suffers an infrastructure deficit that will require trillions of dollars to fill but the implication then is that our politicians focus on providing what can be provided by the common people if only their lives are better for it and they are in an environment where they can prosper (for themselves, by themselves).</p>

<p>A documentary by the History Channel titled “The Men Who Built America” details how in under 25 years the whole of America was connected through rail lines by men who were interested in advancing their business interests while the government focused on spending on waging wars, foreign policy and R &amp; D without which we might not even have had the 8th wonder of the world – the Internet.</p>

<p>Back here at home, our representatives have spent 8 months passing 3 bills with no agenda or direction as to what policies and bills that could be passed that would favour the CHANGE agenda that they supposedly have. I like to think that the 8th Assembly is a replication of representation as usual and Nigerians should not expect more than what transpired in the 7th Senate.</p>

<p>It is high time that this 8th Senate sits back, draw out a goal, put down some plans and start to execute the passage of bills that will make life better for Nigerians or should we have to draw out a job description for them?</p>

    <p class="meta">February 17, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>Barring any last minute change, the re-scheduled senatorial elec¬tions in the East and Central sen¬atorial districts of Kogi State will hold this week Saturday, February 20th.</p>

<p>The senators representing Kogi Central and East senatorial districts, Muhammed Salami Ohiare and Abdul Abdullahi, respectively, on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, had their elections nullified by the Court of Ap¬peal sitting in Abuja last year Decem¬ber. The court also barred the two of them from participating in the fresh election.</p>

<p>As it stands in the central senatorial district, PDP’s Alhaji Ahmed Ogembe will be running against candidates of PPA (Senator Nuru¬deen Abatemi-Usma), SDP (Dr. Moses Wokili) and LP (Kabiru Att). However, the tussle in the east senatorial district will feature PDP’s Attai Aidoko and LP’s Ibrahim Itodo.</p>

<p>The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, had last week an¬nounced that Ohiare, Abdullahi and a member of the House of Representatives, Abdullahi Bello (Okene/Ogori-Magongo), as well as two other state House of Assembly members who contested on APC plat¬form had been barred from partaking in the poll, in adherence to the court rulings.</p>

<p>INEC said the ruling APC and its candidates will not participate in five constituencies in the re-run elections in the state due to the judgement of the Appeal Court. The commission also revealed that it had made arrangement to con¬duct the re-run election in 1,988 poll¬ing units in 14 local government areas of Kogi State.</p>

<p>Kogi State Resident Electoral Com¬missioner, Mallam HaliruPai, disclosed this during a stakeholders meeting. According to him, the re-run election will hold on February 20 in two senatorial districts of the state, Kogi Central and Kogi East.</p>

<p>He further disclosed that the APC will not be participating in the Kogi Central and East senatorial districts elections following the court ruling which barred the two candidates and the APC from contesting.</p>

<p>Mallam Pai also added that APC will not participate in the federal constitu¬ency election in Okene/Ogorimagongo federal constituency also as a result of court ruling adding that only the candi¬date of the PDP is eligible for the re-run election.</p>

<p>This automatically concedes victory to Hon. Tijani Damisa, the candidate of the PDP for the federal constituency.</p>

<p>On the Kogi State House of Assembly re-run election, the REC said APC and its candidates will not participate in Ofu and Ankpa 1 re-run elections, but said APC will participate in Idah, Deki-na Biraidu and Okura re-run elections, stressing that the Idah re-run election will only take place in one unit, Ogegele ward, unit 001.</p>

<p>On the readiness of the commission, Pai noted that about 9,816 ad-hoc staff including members of the National Youth Service Corps, security and assistant personnels will be participating in the re-run election.</p>

<p>Assuring the people of the state of free and fair re-run election, Pai said that the re-run election was as a result of non-conduct of primary by one of the party in the state which led to litigation.</p>

<p>It is our considered view that however the two cases, Kogi Central, East rerun polls, go; we will surely see an expansion in the scope of electoral litigations in the country. This is definitely yet to begin!</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/interrogating-2016-budget-gbenga-adesina">Opinion: Interrogating the 2016 Budget – Gbenga Adesina</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">January 27, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>Our persuasion is that budget offers us an un-gilded window into the soul of a government as expressed in its fiscal priorities. Is a government pro-people? Does this government wake up thinking of you or is it just another incarnate of the political class and their tendencies?</p>

<p>Budget is how you know. Budget is how you measure a government’s change slogan as a function of mere mantra or as a function of well-heeled intentions.</p>

<p>Of course this analysis will not pretend to be exhaustive. There is an explosion of information and/or civic consciousness in our nation now and there’s the possibility, in our lifetime, of information equity because of the excellent pioneering work of some civic startups.</p>

<p>So here’s the précis: ₦6.08 trillion Naira in total (benchmarked on 38 dollars per barrel of crude and 2.2 million barrels per day production capacity).</p>

<p>This shows a 70/30 recurrent expenditure to capital expenditure ratio (i.e. ₦4.28 trillion/₦1.2trillion) and a ₦2.2 trillion deficit core.</p>

<p>Going forward, what does this say to us of the Buhari/Osinbajo regime? Is there a peek this offers us into the core of this government? How does this speak to the years to come?</p>

<p>For instance, the ₦200 billion special intervention (social investment) allocation speaks not only to the heart of the Buhari/Osinbajo mandate (as a government of the mekunus/masses). It signifies, as it appears to me, a clear economic philosophy departure from the preceding Obasanjo/Jonathan years.</p>

<p>You will recollect that these preceding regimes were essentially proponents of trickle-down economics i.e. the believe/policy thrust that more waivers, concessions, local content support or other government stimulus package (Aviation Fund, Rice quotas) for the big monies, for instance, an Alhaji Mondogo of the Mondogo Sugar Refinery Company, will inexorably lead to expansion and more jobs through which a semi-skilled Mr. Sule might be employed and empowered to pay his daughter’s school fees and set up his wife in a micro fried fish business. The wife in turn will buy and sow more clothes from Iya Kabiru etc. Trickle-down economics!</p>

<p>With the 2016 proposed special intervention package however, trickle-down economics will be bypassed directly to offer dignity and prospect nets for the most vulnerable in the society. The possibilities this proposes for a sub-demographic of our population is so vast if considering the scaled down vulnerability index of CRC 2008/2009:</p>

<p>• Insecurity (ranging from insecure environments to conflict and violence)</p>

<p>• Limited citizenship (lack of a meaningful political voice)</p>

<p>• Spatial disadvantage (exclusion from politics, markets, resources, etc., owing to geographical remoteness); and</p>

<p>• Social discrimination (which traps people in exploitative relationships of power and patronage)</p>

<p>Most of these funds will be channeled through micro credit grants/loans, school feeding and nutritional supplement programs, welfare stipends and conditional cash transfers which will find expression as Basic Income Guarantee (BIGs) and Poverty Reduction Accelerator Investment (PRAI) etc. Women, children and rural households will be the biggest beneficiaries. Unemployed youths are also targeted.</p>

<p>The argument for social protection/investment is straight up simple. I have made it a couple of times. It is not socialism or communism. For the children involved, it is the nation as a father to all. It is government saying look we understand that the circumstance of your birth or nurture or lack thereof has put you in a position of disadvantage.</p>

<p>And by God we wish we could give you the Dubai vacations and the merry things the Lekki kids have but we can’t. What we can give you is a good school, if you are willing to go; a great teacher and books to put the world within your grasp, if you promise to pay attention.</p>

<p>We will feed you so that hunger doesn’t break your spirit, we will give you healthcare so that you stay alive. And if you work hard, there will be paths and steps that lead ahead so that you can transcend the deficiency of earlier circumstances into a brighter life because let’s face it, the parents or grandparents of those Lekki kids started in circumstances much similar to your own.</p>

<p>It’s a simple bargain.</p>

<p>Hence, an opportunity of a reset button across generations. Your father’s lack doesn’t have to be yours if you are willing to work hard. It is the wheel of greatness, the very possibility of upward mobility across two or three generations.</p>

<p>And it is smart economics too.</p>

<p>You remember there is a per capital dimension to the GDP of nations? Social investment increases the return on investment/value on humans. The fish seller young woman could have been a doctor, I tell you. Education and opportunity is the gap.</p>

<p>More of our people will be included in a productive space of skills and capacities where they can provide and support families, break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy and the adjacent indexes that flow with them (maternal and infant mortality etc.). But this budget is not just about social investments (I could go on and on about social opportunities though; it is one of the central arguments of my life).</p>

<p>For instance, the 70/30 recurrent expenditure to capital expenditure ratio (as against 88/12, 77/23, 68.72/31.28 in the 2015, 2014 and 2013 budgets respectively) doesn’t in anyway, for me, rouse ovation. A huge chunk of this recurrent expenditure is bloated overhead/personnel cost.</p>

<p>Some fall disproportionately within the presidency itself where for instance the ₦3.9 billion budgeted for annual routine maintenance of Aso Rock far outweighs the ₦2.6 billion allocated to the construction of hospitals across the length and breadth of the entire nation.</p>

<p>But what is most shocking for me is that of the ₦2.2 trillion deficit, over 400 billion would be frittered on recurrent consumption. Awh! Who does that?</p>

<p>This is like you borrowing money from a shylock neighbor and then heading off to Chicken Republic to order two chicken laps, three large kegs of Yoghurt, four hot dogs and five meat pies and eating everything in one sitting.</p>

<p>Who does that?!</p>

<p>There is something even worse, and I suspect it’s the cause of the ache I have been feeling in my left lung for some time now. It will shock you too. This budget is only about 9 percent reduction in the recurrent expenditure of the Jonathan regime. Just 9 percent!</p>

<p>This is shocking.</p>

<p>There is something else, a highly deficient forecast capacity. The 2016 budget benchmark of 38 dollars per barrel is already under water as global oil price has already fallen to 27 dollars as at last week. The recent aggravation in the Niger Delta has already started, though not yet really statistically significant to scissor into the production benchmark.</p>

<p>The international Energy Agency has said things could bottom out with the price falling as low as 20 dollars per barrel. How do we run this budget if this happens?</p>

<p> It gets even worse. I’ll tell you why: the recent lifting of sanctions on Iran (and this was a long time coming, as early as the 2008 Democratic primaries debate when Obama said he would be willing to negotiate with Iran and Cuba with no pre conditions, you remember?) the oil glut will increase. South Africa and India might veer towards Iran for their energy supplies. What do we do then?</p>

<p>Things, however, are not all grey, okay? With proposed massive government fiscal intervention in infrastructure, education, health and social opportunities, there should be some cushioning effect/lag phase that stalls the day to day living harsh effect of recession on the people and perhaps to a large extent (not totally though) confine our woes to macro-economic details.</p>

<p>On a concluding note, a couple of weeks ago when the budget went missing, we were all aghast. When it was returned, the difference was largely the 1 billion Naira reduction in state house overhead and 3.2 billion reduction in what was budgeted for BMW saloon cars and SUVs for the presidency.</p>

<p>Was it the outrage of the people that got Mr. President to reconsider that exorbitant allocation or was it that he was never privy to the arrangement in the first instance? Was it that the people around him had just gone ahead with business as usual in architecting the budget for the most part?</p>

<p>And that leads to my most salient point and this is it:</p>

<p>Can we be sure that the handlers along the corridors of power will not infuse their own tendencies into the appropriation of this budget or policy spin offs?</p>

<p>In a budget, where the main thrust seem to be massive social investment and stimulus spending, the real crux will not lie with just an obviously determined and perhaps well intentioned president. It will be up to his aides (handlers), cabinet members and civil servants to make things happen. Can we count on them to execute and implement these policies with sheer tenacity and love for country?</p>

<p>Social policies fly on the back of a great civil service. Do we have one in place? The logistics is always an uphill task (you should google the initial hiccups of OBAMACARE). Can we surmount this, can we mobilize enough human resource, will power, private sector grade of discipline and drive to achieve this in a space essentially mottled by a sub-climate of self-love and averageness?</p>

<p>Please, don’t say: let’s wait and see.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/nigerias-2016-budget-change-missing">Nigeria's 2016 Budget of Change Missing!</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">January 15, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>President Buhari's 2016 “Budget of Change” went missing due to political reasons, a news report has stated. Several thousand of hard and soft copies of the important document allegedly disappeared from the National Assembly, going by media reports on January 12th.</p>

<p>Several senators said they couldn't find their copy of the budget and thus couldn't discuss or pass it during resumption to plenary on Tuesday after their Christmas and New Year recess.</p>

<p>The incident generated a lot of noise in the nation with several individuals pointing accusing fingers. Some alleged that President Buhari submitted an empty box when presenting the budget to a joint session of the national assembly in December, 2015. International media has described it as a humiliating experience for the Nigerian government.</p>

<p>Senate leadership has however denied the reports and said the matter would be discussed soon. The Red Chamber added that it aims to pass the budget before February.</p>

<p>Following the melee, reports have it that the document deliberately went missing so some changes could be made to it. “Both the leadership of the National Assembly and the presidency, as well as Ministry of Finance and the Budget Office, were working to discreetly change certain parameters of the budget proposal following the slide in the global oil price,” the report said.</p>

<p>The current price of oil has fallen $8 below the oil benchmark for the 2016 budget, hovering at $30 per barrel. Other benchmark, the naira exchange rate, might also be adjusted. The Naira has come under intense pressure and many investors see devaluation in the corner.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/senates-3-bills-7-months-matters-arising">Senate’s 3-bills in 7 months: Matters Arising!</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">January 12, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>Seven months into the life of the 8th Senate, the senators have so far considered 125 bills and 48 motions on issues relating to various aspects in the country. Out of the bills considered, only three were passed, eight are in second reading and 114 are in first reading.</p>

<p>The National Assembly, comprising the Senate and the House of Representatives is charged with the responsibility of making laws for the country through bills.  Section 58 (1) of the1999 Constitution, says “The power of the National Assembly to make laws shall be exercised through bills passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives...”</p>

<p>Inaugurated on June 9 last year, amidst what people saw as a controversial manner, the first bill that was passed by this Senate was on December 1, 2015. It was the supplementary budget, an executive bill from President Muhammadu Buhari.  On the 17 of the same month, the senators also passed the “Electronic Transactions Bill (SB.15) sponsored by Senator Hope Uzodimma (PDP, Imo West). Before embarking on the Christmas and New Year break on 22, December, the senators passed the third bill, the 2015 Appropriation Amendment Act, which was also an executive bill from President Buhari.</p>

<p>The bill, which has since been assented to by President Buhari, extends the capital component of the 2015 budget to March 31st, this year.</p>

<p>Of all the bills that are being considered on the floor of the red chamber, no bill attracted the attention of Nigerian masses as the one sponsored by Senator Bala Ibn Na’Allah (APC, Kebbi South).  The bill, which scaled through second reading on December 2nd set the lawmakers against the social media public. Named, “an Act to prohibit frivolous petitions; and other matters connected therewith”, the bill was renamed the Anti-Social Media Bill. The prescription of ‘two years jail or a fine of N2m or both’ for social media abusers was the main contentious part of the bill.</p>

<p>One area that attracted several bills sponsored by the senators is the 1999 Constitution. So far, six bills have been sponsored to amend various section of the constitution. From all indications, amendment of the constitution will feature prominently on the agenda of the 8th Senate.</p>

<p>Recall that efforts by the 7th Assembly to review the constitution under the chairmanship of the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, hit the rocks after billions of naira were reportedly sunk in it. Already, a new committee has been set up by Senate President Bukola Saraki with Ekweremadu as chairman.</p>

<p>Aside from lawmaking, the Senate also carried out probes in the period under review. Out of all the investigation undertaken by the legislators that of the erstwhile chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Lamorde, chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) Danladi Umar and that on Treasury Single Account (TSA) got unequal attention.</p>

<p>The commencement of the probes of Lamorde and Umar at a time issues affecting Saraki were being probed by the duo created an impression that the Senate President was fighting back.  Lamorde’s probe commenced when the Senate President’s wife, Mrs Toyin Saraki, was facing corruption charges at the EFCC, while that of Umar began when Saraki was facing charges at the CCT over false declaration of assets.</p>

<p>It was at the peak of the Senate investigation that Lamorde was sacked at the EFCC and since then his case has been hanging on the Senate. Similarly, the pace of Umar’s case at the Senate has been slowed as that of Saraki at the CCT.</p>

<p>The dust raised by the legislators on the one percent commission being deducted under the TSA by Systemspecs, owners of the remita software that is used for the TSA transactions opened the eyes of federal government to the magnitude of money the company is making in conjunction with the Central Bank of Nigeria and commercial banks.</p>

<p>The probe on the TSA is still ongoing but the one percent charges have since been stopped. The confession of the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, that he got to know of the magnitude of the commission being deducted under the TSA through the Senate blossomed the ego of the lawmakers.</p>

<p>Speaking on the floor of the chamber, a day after the investigative hearing was carried out on the TSA, Saraki said; “The outcome of the investigative hearing has punctured the claim that we are not doing anything for the good of the country. I want us not to be derailed, if by one singular action, we have saved this country N8.8bn, this shows we are working,” he said.</p>

<p>Senate Leader Ali Ndume while commenting on how they have fared so far, said they have done creditably well in the performance of their constitutional responsibilities. He said all hanging probes and bills would be dealt with in the second half of the 2015/2016 legislative year.</p>

<p>“We have passed three bills, eight are in second reading and 114 are in first reading. We have also considered 48 motions. All the probes that are being carried out by ad hoc committees will be continued by the standing committees and we are even going to continue with those that were started during the last senate,” he said.</p>

<p>A survey conducted by a group monitoring the activities of the National Assembly, showed that the lawmakers are already in breach of Section 163 of the 1999 Constitution, which requires the legislators to sit for a minimum legislative days of 181  every year. The survey showed that in the first half of their first year, the Senate sat for only 47 days. Same also applies to members of the House of Representatives. It is therefore doubtful how the lawmakers would make up for the shortfall in the second half of the year.</p>

<p>Interestingly, both chambers of the National Assembly preoccupied themselves raising multiplicity of motions on both floors of the congress.  The unfortunate thing about those motions is that some of them were not well thought out and frivolous to say the least. Besides, almost all the motions without exception were not thoroughly, painstakingly, seriously or conscientiously debated before arriving at resolutions on them. The implication of that is that those resolutions, like the ones in the previous assembly, will not command the authority of the executive or President for implementation.</p>

<p>So far, in both chambers of the National Assembly, it has been difficult to single out star legislators to look up to, to distinguish themselves in the current 8th assembly as was the case in the previous 7th assembly.</p>

<p>It was however, not all gloom in the first half of the year in the National Assembly. There were some highpoints. In the Senate for instance, the Senate President, Bukola Saraki led a strong delegation of the Senate to visit the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the insurgency-infested Borno State. The Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu undertook a similar mission in Adamawa State.</p>

<p>Also, through the proactive action of the Senate, the lawmakers were able to unearth and halt the sum of N25 billion, being the one per cent commission on the N2.5 trillion collected from the Treasury Single Account (TSA).</p>

<p>As the lawmakers resume on Tuesday, January 12th, Nigerians are watching how they would dispense the probes and the 2016 budget proposal presented by President Muhammadu Buhari.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/finally-bayelsadecides-now-conclusive">Finally, #BayelsaDecides Now Conclusive!</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">January 11, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p><img src="/media_root/file_archive/BayelsaDecided.jpg" title="Bayelsa Decided" alt="Bayelsa Decided" /></p>

<p>Governor Seriakae Dickson was on January 9th returned as the winner of the Bayelsa State governorship election. This followed the declaration of the results of the supplementary elections conducted in Southern Ijaw Local Government Area and 101 polling units in six other local government areas.</p>

<p>The supplementary elections followed the cancellation of the election in Southern Ijaw and the 101 units due to irregularities in the governorship election conducted on December 5, 2015.  Dickson, who was the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, polled 134,988 votes to triumph over his predecessor and candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Chief Timipire Sylva who polled 86,852 votes. A total of 232,167 votes were cast in the election out of which 6,647 votes were rejected as invalid.</p>

<p>Moses Siasia, a younger brother of Nigeria’s Under 23 football coach, Samson Siasia, who was the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Movement, PDM, took a distant third with 1,572 votes despite a high-profile campaign.</p>

<p>Sylva, who had earlier predicated his possible victory in the governorship election to amassing significant votes to wipe away the 30,000 plus lead of Dickson, garnered last December, however, failed to record the upset in the local government area. In the end, he got only 10,216 votes out of the 33,607 valid votes cast in the local government area that is also the base of Dickson’s late patron and first civilian governor of the state, Chief Diepreye Alamieyeseigha.</p>

<p>Although it was an election, it seemed more like a war. Intimidation, ballot box-snatching and shooting were rampant. A coalition of 60 Civil Society Organisations condemned the PDP and the APC for their actions and statements in the run-up to balloting. It beggars belief that these criminal acts occurred in spite of the fact that Solomon Arase, the Inspector-General of Police, deployed 5,000 officers, boats and helicopters for the polls. There were also military and 4,000 Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps personnel on duty.</p>

<p>Yet, on January 7, hoodlums were able to bomb the country home of the Speaker, Bayelsa House of Assembly, Konbowei Benson, destroying part of the property in Korokorosie, Southern Ijaw. A former speaker of the state legislature, Boyelayefa Debekeme, the Chairman of Ekeremor LG, Billy Tobiye, and the traditional ruler, Agbodo Gbaseimo, were attacked on the eve of the election.</p>

<p>Following the declaration of the results, Barrister Otiotio, agent of the APC candidate immediately renounced the declaration of Dickson as the winner, saying the election should have been declared inconclusive on the claim that the difference between the two leading candidates was less than the number of cancelled votes. He also alleged irregularities in voting in some sections of the state. His claim was immediately dismissed by Agbedi, the PDP agent who blamed the irregularities on the APC even as he acclaimed the performance of Dickson as the reason for the PDP victory.</p>

<p>However, the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, the highest elected PDP official in the Federal Government, congratulated Dickson saying the victory was sweet. He said: “It is a sweet victory, coming against all odds. It is a testimony to the performance and popularity of Governor Seriake Dickson and our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.</p>

<p>“I commend the people of Bayelsa State for standing up to be counted, for protecting their democratic rights to freely choose their leaders. They have made a resounding statement to the effect that the state remains a PDP enclave and that they are committed to keeping it so.” He, however, charged Governor Dickson to repay Bayelsans for their faith in the PDP and his leadership credentials with greater transformation in his second term. He also enjoined him to reach out to his opponents for the peace and progress of the state, while ensuring that every part of the state is fairly treated irrespective of their political choices.</p>

<p>The state chapter of the PDP, however, rued what it described as the cost of human lives it took the party to achieve victory. The party stated this through the Director of Publicity, Restoration Campaign Organisation, Jonathan Obuebite, shortly after the declaration of the results. “It’s painful that this victory has come with so much pain because we lost dear ones. Those who died are our brothers. So many are yet in the hospitals nursing life threatening injuries because our opponents wanted to win at all cost. We wish to express our deepest condolences once again and to assure them that their death will not be in vain”, it stated.</p>

<p>In his acceptance speech, Bayelsa State Governor, Henry Seriake Dickson, thanked the electorate for ensuring his re-election for another four years, but said there would be no celebration because of the number of lives that have been lost. The governor in an emotion-laden statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Daniel Iworiso-Markson, released to journalists in Yenagoa, however, vowed that he would do everything possible to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice. He promised to work tirelessly to justify the mandate given to him “as we tried to do in the first four years to almost universal acknowledgement and approbation.”</p>

<p>The crusade for peaceful polls and the integrity of our elections should start with the prosecution of the offenders in the Bayelsa poll. And it is a step in the right direction that Arase has vowed to prosecute all those who committed criminal acts in the Bayelsa election.</p>

<p> They must not get away with their savagery. The President should compel Arase to enforce the provisions against violent conduct, murder and criminality as enshrined in the Electoral Act 2010 and the 1999 Constitution. This move will serve as a good lesson to sponsors of violence and hired hands ahead of the 2019 general election.</p>

    <p class="meta">January 8, 2016</p>

    <div>
      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will tomorrow, Saturday (January 9), conduct supplementary elections in Southern Ijaw LGA and some polling units in three other LGAs (Nembe, Ogbia and Brass) where elections were cancelled.</p>

<p>A new date was fixed for the polls after a consultative meeting with leaders of political parties who fielded candidates in the December 5, 2015 Bayelsa governorship election and the candidates who contested the election at the INEC headquarters.</p>

<p>The INEC had on Monday, December 7, 2015 cancelled the election in Southern Ijaw, following widespread violence, ballot box snatching and abduction of electoral officials.</p>

<p>Since the cancellation of the elections, tension has remained high in Bayelsa, with supporters of the two main contenders engaging in verbal war and reports of residents fleeing Southern Ijaw local government area</p>

<p>Responsively, the federal government has deployed hundreds of soldiers, policemen and other security agents to ensure safety of the electorate. Southern Ijaw has a total of 120,827 registered voters, which makes up 18% of Bayelsa state’s 663,639 total registered voters.</p>

<p>From the first ballot, the incumbent Governor and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Henry Seriake Dickson leads former Governor and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Timipre Sylva, based on election results declared so far.</p>

<p>Sylva won only in his locality –Brass, while Dickson won in 4 of 5 local government areas announced, garnering a total of 81,929 votes against Sylva’s of 56,514 votes. 25,415 votes currently separate the 2 aspirants as they head on to tomorrow’s rerun both aiming to garner needed votes from the Southern Ijaw voters.</p>

    <p class="meta">January 6, 2016</p>

      <p><img src="/media_root/file_archive/Ekiti_Zamfara__Sokoto_LGA_Polls2.jpg" title="Grappling With the Aftermath of Ekiti, Zamfara &amp; Postponed Sokoto Council Polls" alt="IMAGE" /></p>

<p>The aftermath of the Ekiti State Local Government election held in 16 councils of the state, where the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was declared winner of all the seats, was quite predictable, as the All Progressives Congress (APC) had declined to participate in the election.</p>

<p>The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) won all the 16 chairmanship and 177 councillorship positions contested in the local government elections held in the state on Saturday, December 19th 2015. Five political parties contested in the election as the PDP made a clean sweep at the poll.</p>

<p>Reacting on the conduct of the LG election, Duro Faseyi, senator representing the Ekiti North Senato¬rial District in the National Assembly, praised Governor Fayose for installing demo¬cratic structures in the 16 council areas of the state by conducting local gov¬ernment elections, say¬ing this would guarantee some level of indepen¬dence for the third tier that he described as piv¬otal to the country’s devel¬opment. He lambasted the All Progressives Congress (APC) for boycotting the council polls.</p>

<p>However, Taiwo Olatunbosun, the APC publicity secretary in Ekiti state, commended voters in the state for boycotting the Saturday election. Olatunbosun said that the people behaved honourably for staying away from the election boycotted by all political parties except the PDP. He described the exercise as a mockery of democratic election, saying an election with a single party participating while also raising PDP members to pose as candidates of obscure parties would never pass the test of representative poll.</p>

<p>The party added that across the state, Ekiti people spoke with one voice by staying in their homes and watched from distance as PDP members engaged in multiple thumb-printing to give the impression that there was massive turn-out of voters.</p>

<p>Consequent to the Ekiti Drama, the All Progressive Congress (APC) won all the chairmanship positions in Zamfara State local council election held on Saturday, January 2nd 2016.</p>

<p>The Chairman of the Zamfara State Independent Electoral Commission, Garba Muhammad, noted that all the candidates of the APC in the 14 councils had met all the provisions of the electoral law and had been declared winners of the election in their respective councils. He said 14 political parties including the Peoples Democratic Party, participated in the election.</p>

<p>The PDP, however, in a statement signed by its State Chairman, Hassan Nasiha, on eve of the election, said it was boycotting the election. The party also said since it was still challenging the election of Governor Abdulaziz Yari at the Supreme Court, it would not participate in the election.</p>

<p>Mr. Muhammad, Zamfara Electoral Agency boss, commended all stakeholders, including security agencies, for ensuring the success of the election.</p>

<p>Further to the polls in Ekiti and Zamfara, the Sokoto State Independent Electoral Commission (SIEC) has announced the postponement of the local government council’s election earlier billed for this Saturday, January 9th, 2016.</p>

<p>The Chairman of the commission, Alhaji Usman Abubakar noted that the postponement was due to the non receipt of the card readers they wanted to borrow from their sister agency, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.</p>

<p>This was due to the bye-election which the federal commission is set to conduct in Bayelsa on the same date. According to the SIEC chairman, the commission may likely conduct the postponed polls before end of the first quarter of 2016.</p>

<p>”Nine political parties are participating in the elections and we intend to conduct free, credible, transparent and acceptable polls,” Abubakar, promised.</p>

<p>The first of local government <a href="http://www.shineyoureye.org/info/local-government-elections" title="LG Polls">elections</a> in this new political dispensation will take place tomorrow in Ekiti State.</p>

<p>However, the timing is precisely 14 months after the governor was sworn-in.</p>

<p>Initially, the All Progressives Congress (APC) filed a case in the High Court in a bid to stop the conduct of the local government election, based on the allegation that the chairman of the State Independent Electoral Commission (SIEC) is a card carrying member of the governor’s party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).</p>

<p>The suit was adjudged baseless and without merit.</p>

<p>As the APC decides to appeal the judgement, 5 political parties will participate in the polls tomorrow –</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/kogi-bayelsa-guber-polls-inconclusive-elections-an">Kogi & Bayelsa Guber Polls: Matters Arising – Ishola Monsur</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">December 8, 2015</p>

    <div>
      <p><img src="/media_root/file_archive/SYE_Blog_-_Kogi__Bayelsa_1.jpg" title="Kogi &amp; Bayelsa Polls 2015" alt="Kogi &amp; Bayelsa Polls" /></p>

<p>Another set of elections have come and gone. The same problems and symptoms have emerged. It is unnerving that at this stage in our development, we still cannot get our elections right. It is obvious that the people in authority do not want free, fair and credible elections.</p>

<p>We have undergone biometric voter’s registration exercise and Permanent Voters Card (PVC) verification through Smart Card Readers (SCR). Nigerians are not too dumb to utilize electronic voting.</p>

<p> Kogi State supplementary elections and Bayelsa State governorship elections were held this past weekend. Smart card readers failed again and there were incidences of election violence.</p>

<p>According to news reports, thugs disrupted voting in Anyigba at Eti Aja 2 – Dekina LGA in Kogi State. Apparently, thugs stormed some of the polling units in the area, shooting sporadically into air shortly after accreditation, but normalcy was returned to the polling units by security agents only for the thugs to appear again and chased the voters on queue away, disrupting the entire voting arena.</p>

<p>Independent national Electoral Commission (INEC) ad hoc staff and prospective voters ran away for their safety. Clearly, the results from those units should be cancelled if the story is substantiated.</p>

<p>Already, the All Progressives Party (APC) governorship Candidate, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, has emerged winner in the Kogi State governorship supplementary election polling 6,885 votes to defeat incumbent governor and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Mr Idris Wada, who got 5,363 votes.</p>

<p>Bello was declared Governor-elect by the state Returning Officer, Professor Kusa Emmanuel, having polled a total of 247,752 as against PDP's 204,877 votes.</p>

<p>But in Bayelsa, the story is not much different as it relates to election violence and failure of the card readers. It was a tight contest between the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Hon. Seriake Dickson, and his All Progressives Congress (APC) rival, Chief Timipre Sylva, in the Saturday State governorship election that claimed at least four lives and injured several others as violence broke out in part of the state.</p>

<p>The additional factor in Bayelsa is that there appears to be voter apathy. Bayelsans may feel the result is pre-determined from the Oga at the top (nationally). Interestingly, the Bayelsa election puts the immediate past PDP governor of the State Timipre Sylva (now in APC) against the current governor and PDP candidate, Seriake Dickson.</p>

<p>The venom and animosity between the two is only matched by the desire for vengeance by the one who feels unjustly kicked out. The results were still too close to call by Sunday evening before it was declared inconclusive by the state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Baritor Kpagih.</p>

<p>Once again, any Nigerian that engages in election violence, including ballot box snatching should be subjected to the death penalty, if not just for the impunity, but also for the stupidity.</p>

<p>Edo State governorship elections, Anambra State elections and other States will come before the big one in 2019. INEC and security forces must get their act together. We are all tired of the same problems repeating themselves.</p>

<p>The current INEC chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu who took over from the acting Chairman Hajia Amina Bala Zakari on Monday, November 9th, 2015 has enough seasoned staff and the process is neither new nor is it rocket science. Also, before handing over, Amina Zakari assured Nigerians ”that INEC will use the opportunity presented by forthcoming Kogi and Bayelsa governorship elections to continue to display its improved processes and rigour” and “ that the Commission was raising the bar during the Kogi and Bayelsa outings.”</p>

<p>We are worried about the “stand alone governorship elections in Anambra, Ekiti and Osun states, and the General Elections”.</p>

<p>See INEC WILL USE KOGI AND BAYELSA GOVERNORSHIP ELECTIONS TO DISPLAY IMPROVED PROCESSES AND RIGOUR – Amina Zakari” posted on INEC official website www.inecnigeria.org.</p>

<p>The citizens are not deceived. There has been no high profile prosecution and conviction for election violence or malpractices since the return to democracy in 1999. In other words, we are indirectly encouraging election rigging by failing to prosecute and punish violators.</p>

<p>The 2010 Electoral Act as amended is replete with penalties for election offenses. For example, concerning disorderly conduct at elections, Section 128 0f the 2010 Electoral Act (as amended), states that “Any person who at an election acts or incites others to act in a disorderly manner commits an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a maximum fine of N500,000 or imprisonment for a term of 12 months or both.” Has anyone been convicted and imprisoned in the last sixteen years for disorderly conduct at elections in Nigeria?</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that you get a stiffer penalty for snatching a ballot box than for possessing a weapon. Compare the following subsections of Section 128:</p>

<p>“(3) A person who contravenes any of the provisions of this section commits an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of N100,000 or imprisonment for 6 months for every such offence. (4) Any person who snatches or destroys any election material shall be liable on conviction to 24 months imprisonment.”</p>

<p>Subsection (3) includes penalty for “ (1) No person shall on the date on which an election is held do any of the following acts or things in a polling unit or within a distance of 300 metres of a polling unit … (f) be in possession of any offensive weapon or wear any dress or have any facial or other decoration which in any event is calculated to intimidate voters;”</p>

<p>The nation awaits the prosecution of election offenders and their co-conspirators, no matter how highly placed. More so, there is no reason why the card readers are not working 100% by now – unless, there is a premeditated reason with a pre-determined outcome in mind.</p>

<p>It is our considered view that however the two cases, Kogi and Bayelsa, go; we will surely see an expansion in the scope of electoral discussions in this country. This is definitely yet to begin!</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/taraba-comprehension">Taraba In Comprehension - O.S.A. Aluko</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">December 2, 2015</p>

    <div>
      <p><img src="/media_root/file_archive/Nigeria_Taraba_State_map.png" title="Taraba Comprehension(Map)" alt="Taraba Map" /></p>

<p>Since the 4th republic began in 1999, Taraba North had produced Rev. Jolly Nyame as governor (8 years), Taraba Central produced Danbaba Suntai who was to end his 8 years tenure in 2015.</p>

<p>Taraba South was the only zone yet to produce a candidate to attain the position. It is in view of this that agitations kept arising from different quarters, especially the southern district that zoning would play a key role in ascertaining who succeeds Governor Suntai by 2015.</p>

<p>Danbaba Suntai’s health problem started on October 25, 2012, when a plane he piloted crashed in Yola. He endured brain injuries in the air crash and was transferred from a hospital in Yola to the National Hospital, Abuja, on October 26, 2012, and later flown to Germany and U.S. where he spent about a year in hospitals receiving treatment.</p>

<p>After a period of political crisis in the state based on claims and counterclaims over his health status, it was revealed that the governor was not healthy enough to live in Nigeria without adequate treatment, or to govern a state.</p>

<p>Due to his state of health, his deputy, Alhaji Umar Garba, was confirmed as the acting governor, pending when the governor would be fit enough to resume full leadership of the state.</p>

<p>Finally in Nov. 10, 2014, Governor Danbaba Suntai returned to the country after a period in the United Kingdom. Suntai arrived Jalingo when the acting governor (Garba Umar) was away in Abuja.</p>

<p>Many people in Jalingo were taken unawares as there appeared to be no prior information about the governor’s return to the state. Reporters at the airport confirmed that Suntai looked physically and mentally sound, and even recognised all his supporters who gathered to receive him at the airport by their name.</p>

<p>However, as Suntai’s supporters were happy and jubilating at his coming, the group in support of his deputy, the Acting Governor, Garba Umar, in Jalingo was in a bad mood as his return did not go down well with them.</p>

<p>Some saw his return to the state as a good omen while others believed he was back to stop Umar from achieving his goal of becoming the governor come 2015.</p>

<p>Incidentally, on November 21, 2014, The Supreme Court ordered that the Taraba State acting governor Garba Umar be removed and the allegedly impeached deputy governor, Abubakar Danladi to be sworn-in.</p>

<p>As it had initially occurred, Danladi was impeached by the Taraba State House of Assembly in September 2012 for gross misconduct and engaging in private businesses. This was just about a month before the governor of the state, Dambaba Suntai, was involved in an air accident in the year 2012.</p>

<p>In a unanimous judgment, the Supreme Court held that the impeachment panel set up by the House of Assembly to investigate the allegations against Danladi violated his rights to fair hearing.</p>

<p>Mr.Garba Umar, as it happened, was appointed to replace Danladi, and later elevated as the acting governor, following Suntai’s ill health that resulted from the crash.</p>

<p>On assumption of office, Danladi nullified all political appointments made by the former acting governor, Garba Umar, from November 14, 2012 to November 21, 2014.</p>

<p>Danladi revealed “After consultations with Governor Danbaba Suntai, the governor has ordered me to nullify all political appointments made in the state from from November 14, 2012 to date.”</p>

<p>The reinstated deputy governor, Danladi, who is from the same village and zone (Nothern) with Umar did not purchase the PDP nomination forms before the deadline for the submission of the forms and did not contest, but his close link with Suntai’s camp, which provided him with moral support and logistics to come back to power, was interpreted by political analysts to favour the candidate of the group who is from the Southern zone.</p>

<p>This is based on the fact that prior to 2012, Governor Suntai was reportedly said to have assured the people of Southern zone that he would ‘transfer’ power to the zone upon completion of his second term in 2015.</p>

<p>The political pendulum in Taraba PDP incidentally favoured former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Architect Darius Dickson Ishaku and David Sabo Kente.</p>

<p>These two had to slug it out with Umar in the primaries to determine who to confront Mama Taraba (Senator Aisha Jummai Alhassan) who hails from Taraba North Senatorial District (the same zone as Umar), of the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>

<p>In the general elections, there were great expectations by Nigerians across the nation that history would be made with Nigeria getting her first female governor.</p>

<p>This hope was further strengthened when the election was declared inconclusive and later concluded 14 days later. However, hopes seemed dashed as Ishiaku was declared winner with a total of 360,318 votes to Hassan’s 275,985.</p>

<p>5 months later, when there seemed to be no hope in sight, the 3-member tribunal ruled that Ishaku was not validly nominated as the candidate of the PDP, and hence didn’t qualify to contest the election in the first place.</p>

<p>The tribunal held that PDP conducted the reported primaries with no clear delegation from the state’s local government areas.</p>

<p>There was great joy in the camp of the now confirmed minister of the federation. Likewise, many legal professionals have turned up to give their opinion on the accuracy of the tribunal’s verdict. PDP and Darius Ishiaku have vowed to appeal the verdict.</p>

<p>Could there still be more political drama in store from Taraba? Whose desire will finally win out, history-mongers or Taraba Southerners? Time will reveal!</p>

    <div>
      <p>On March 28, across all federal constituencies and senatorial districts in Nigeria, citizens voted to decide their representatives in the 8th National Assembly.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SENATE</strong>:</li>
</ul>


<p>At least, five governors, Jonathan Jang (Plateau North), Godswill Akpabio (Akwa Ibom West), Theodore Orji (Abia Central), Mohammed Kwankwaso (Kano Central) and Aliyu Wamakko (Sokoto North) have won their election bid into the Nigerian Senate.</p>

<p>Likewise, David Mark (Senate President) and Ike Ekweremadu (Senate Vice President)  also got re-elected, but they both won’t be retaining their current positions. After spending eight years as president of the Senate, David Mark’s best bet will be the Minority Leader post.</p>

<p>The is because the All Progressives Congress have won more seats than the Peoples Democratic Party in the March 28 elections, and therefore, will be the major political party at the 8th National Assembly. As a result, the APC will produce the Senate President, Senate Vice President, Majority Leader and Chief Whip.</p>

<p>Some PDP senators who lost to APC in the election include Ahmed Makarfi (Kaduna North), Abdul Ningi (Deputy Senate Leader, Bauchi Central), Smart Adeyemi (Kogi West), Hosea Agboola (Oyo North) and Zainab Kure (Niger South).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the majority status the APC will enjoy in the 8th National Assembly, it will also lack a two-third majority (73), needed for key decisions.</p>

<p>The election results also reveal that the next Senate will be male-dominated, as only eight of the 109 elected will be females.</p>

<p>Three of the eight women-senators are of the APC - Oluremi Tinubu (Lagos Central), Alhaja Monsurat Sunmonu (Oyo Central) and Binta Masi Garba (Adamawa North). The other five women are from the PDP - Uche Ekwunife (Anambra), Stella Oduah (Anambra), Abiodun Olujimi (Ekiti South), Fatima Raji-Rasaki (Ekiti Central) and Rose Okoh (Cross River North)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</strong>:</li>
</ul>


<p>In the House of Representatives, about 302 out the 360 members will not return to their seats in the 8th session of the National Assembly.</p>

<p>This includes Aminu Tambuwal (Speaker), Emeka Ihedioha (Deputy Speaker), Mulikat Akande-Adeola (House Majority Leader), Ishaka Bawa (Chief Whip),   Sampson Osagie (Minority Whip), and Abdulrahman Suleiman-Kawu (Deputy Minority Leader).</p>

<p>While the speaker, deputy speaker and some other principal officers vied for either governorship or senatorial positions, most lawmakers lost their re-election bid either at the primaries of their political parties or after the March 28 National Assembly election.</p>

<p>Over 155 lawmakers lost out at the primaries of their political parties, while 147 lost at the general elections. Hence, only about 58 scaled through the hurdles, a relative decrease from 2011 when 99 lawmakers returned from the 2007 set.</p>

<p>Prior to the March 28 elections, the PDP had less than 160 members, a decrease from initial majority strength of 208 in June 2011, as a result of mass defection to the All Progressives Congress. Furthermore, the performance of the PDP at the poll paved way for a further decrease to a membership figure under 150.</p>

<p>Even though PDP cleared all the seats in the South South, South East and had good showings in Taraba, Plateau, Ekiti, Lagos and Benue states, the APC was dominant in the North and several South West states  and won at least 200 of the 360 seats.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, for the first time, a non-indigene, Oghne Egoh of the Peoples Democratic Party, won a federal constituency seat in Lagos. The House of Representative elect for Amuwo Odofin Federal Constituency polled a total of 29,761 votes to defeat the incumbent, Ganiyu Olukolu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who scored 20 616 votes.</p>

    <p class="meta">February 3, 2015</p>

    <div>
      <p>INEC’s intention to put card readers to use in the forthcoming elections is in fact a tech-driven and innovative problem-solving approach. This further re-enforces the hope that each vote cast will represent an eligible voter.</p>

<p>As the cards have been introduced, the period for accreditation has been extended for 1 hour (now 8am to 1pm rather than 8am to 12pm) while voting will be from 1pm to 6pm. 145,000 card readers will be put to use across 119,973 polling units nationwide, hence making available just 25,027 back up card readers available. This means that only 20% of polling units will have back up card readers.</p>

<p>Batteries in the card reader are said to last up to 10 hours when fully charged, still, back-up batteries will be made available at each polling unit. At least this information deals with power issues, however, will this process essentially lead to voter satisfaction?</p>

<p>At the INEC Youth Summit in January 2015, an INEC staff showcased a practical use of the card reader. According to those present, the time taken for the process per person was at least 3 minutes. As a result, with just about 1 card reader in use at most polling units, just about 20 people might be registered within 1 hour.</p>

<p>Now let’s fast forward to Election Day when accreditation is supposed to last for 5 hours. By 1pm, will we have just 100 people accredited in most polling units? What will happen to the remaining 400 people lined up to vote?</p>

<p>The success of the forthcoming elections definitely lies on the shoulders of the electorates, especially the youths. The need to protect votes and maintain peace in the most civil of ways can be met by this demography. With access to mobile phones, relevant reports can be made and prove to be evidence of claims later in the court.</p>

<p>A perfect tool for use is Revoda, a mobile app with the purpose of making voting social. With ReVoDa, EiENigeria seeks to potentially turn the 100 million+ Nigerians with mobile phones, 45 million+ with internet access and 4.6 million+ on Facebook into informal election observers.</p>

<p>Currently, over 1000 registered youths are ready to help observe the forthcoming elections. Obviously, more need to join in order to cover all 120,000 polling units nationwide. Using ReVoDa Mobile is easy, and it starts with the download which you can do <a href="http://eienigeria.org/revoda" title="REVODA">here</a>. Choose the version you prefer between ReVoDa Lite (for regular phones) and ReVoDa Smart (for smart phones)</p>

    <p class="meta">January 30, 2015</p>

    <div>
      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) rescheduled the Niger East senatorial by-election initially for August 30.</p>

<p>All political parties that indicated interest to join the race agreed with INEC for changing the date of the by-election from August 16th to 30th with the exception of APC which disagreed with the commission over the new date.</p>

<p>The following individuals were part of the candidates:</p>

<p>Dr. Shem Zagbayi Nuhu (Peoples Democratic Party, PDP)</p>

<p>Barrister David Umaru (All Progressives Congress, APC)</p>

<p>Isa Mohammed (All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA) and</p>

<p>Abdullahi Shuaibu Dikko (Social Democratic Party, SDP).</p>

<p>Eventually, the August 30 by-election was declared inconclusive due to electoral malpractice in some polling units. Hence, a re-run was held a week later (September 6) in polling units located at Bosso, Chanchaga, Munya, Paikoro, Rafi and Shiroro local government areas.</p>

<p>Consequently, the election result was announced by the returning Officer, Professor Wole Morenikeji.  After collation, Shem Zagbayi Nuhu (PDP) was declared the winner with 92,056 votes while David Umaru (APC) closely followed with 87,405 votes. Isa Bello (APGA) had 2,185 votes while Abdulahi Diko (SDP) scored 419 votes.</p>

<p>However, David Umaru of APC petitioned the tribunal challenging the declaration of Shem Nuhu of PDP by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the winner of the by-election.</p>

<p>In a judgement that lasted for hours on friday, the National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal in Minna upturned the result of the election and decided that the APC candidate was the winner of the election</p>

<p>As a result, Niger state now has 2 APC Senators (Niger East and Niger North Senatorial districts), while PDP holds on to its control of Niger South Senatorial district.</p>

<p><em>Senator Dahiru Awaisu Kuta died on June 12, 2014, leaving the seat vacant.</em></p>

    <p class="meta">January 26, 2015</p>

    <div>
      <p>The debate was organized by PRTVC, YIAGA, Amplified Radio and EIE. It was attended by the three candidates of Labour Party – Amb. Bagudu Hirse; All Progressives Congress – Rt. Hon Simon Lalong; and the People’s Democratic Party — Senator GNS Pwajok. The debate was moderated by Dan Mallam.</p>

<p>The moderator first began by reading out the profiles of the respective candidates; their educational background and work experience.</p>

<p>The debate was formatted in three sets, with questions from a prepared set; social media; then the audience. The questions ranged from education, security, health, infrastructure, economy…</p>

<p>Bagudu Hirse of Labour Party said that improving the fortunes of education starts with primary education; Barrister Simon Lalong said a lack of payment of workers’ salaries is the reason for Plateau’s educational woes; GNS Pwajok responding to question on education said more budgetary provision must be made for education.</p>

<p>Debating the question of security in Plateau, the APC candidate was of the opinion that the crisis stem from elections and a lack of unity amongst Plateau people; GNS Pwajok said Operation Rainbow had to be revamped to help in security of the state while also advocating for state policing; Bagudu Hirse of Labour Party’s take was to encourage elders across the state for more security.</p>

<p>A range of issues were discussed with Bagudu Hirse of Labour Party providing comic relief as he got the audience laughing over his continuous stress on how the answers to all questions posed to him were available in his “7 point agenda” and also his constant reminder of his “international connections.”</p>

<p>Simon Lalong of the APC was for me the most disappointing, he was unprepared and looked to deflect rather than answer questions. On a number of times, he made attacks at the current PDP led government rather than provide solutions to the issues raised.</p>

<p>The PDP’s candidate, Senator GNS Pwajok was by far the most impressive, he made articulate points and was also the most prepared, providing statistics and figures in response to questions.</p>

<p>At the end, the three candidates shook hands, hugged and pledged to work together regardless of the outcome; they also all signed a peace accord pledging to resort to legal channels should they feel aggrieved over the election results and shun violence.</p>

    <p class="meta">November 28, 2014</p>

    <div>
      <p>Many of the 74 defendants in a suit  seeking an order to set aside  state laws prescribing pension for former governors and their deputies did not show up at the Federal High Court in Abuja on Thursday when the matter came up.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs, comprising EiE Nigeria, 35 other civil society organisations and two activists, Ayodeji Kolawole and Tunde Asaju, had asked the court to nullify the laws enacted by the various state Houses of Assembly prescribing pension for former governors and their deputies.</p>

<p>The governors are the 1st to 36th defendants, the various state Houses of Assembly are the 37th to 72nd defendants. While the Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr. Mohammed Adoke (SAN) and the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission  are the 73rd and the 74th defendants respectively.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs claim  that  states’  Houses of Assembly lacked the legislative competence to enact pension laws for public officials when the constitution had conferred the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission with exclusive power to determine the remuneration of public officials.</p>

<p>They further claim that governors, their deputies and other public officials are not entitled to pension as their retirement benefits are already part of the remunerations being paid to them while in office.</p>

<p>The counsel for the 38 plaintiffs in the suit, Mr. Chino Obiagwu, confirmed during the proceedings that 70 out of the total 74 defendants in the suit had been served with the originating summons. However, about 56 of the defendants were absent in court even though they had been served with the originating summons.</p>

<p>Among the 74 defendants, Obiagwu said only the Gombe State governor, his Taraba State counterpart and their respective Houses of Assembly, sued as separate defendants, had not been served because they were not accessible by courier. Obiagwu, therefore indicated his intention to serve them through substituted means.</p>

<p>The absentees included the legal representatives of governors of Lagos, Abia, Kaduna, Anambra, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Borno, Cross River, Delta, Ebonyi, Edo, Enugu, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Kebbi, Nasarawa, Niger, Ogun, Ondo, Oyo, Yobe states and their respective Houses of Assembly. In similar fashion, the Attorney-General of the Federation and the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission failed to show up in court on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Responsively, the trial judge, Justice Ahmed Mohammed, adjourned till January 28, 2015 for mention. He ordered that fresh hearing notices be served on the defendants that were absent. He also directed the plaintiffs’ counsel to file his intended ex parte application seeking substituted service of the originating summon on Gombe and Taraba State governors and their respective Houses of Assembly, before the next adjourned date.</p>

<p>Apart from seeking an order nullifying the various pension laws, the plaintiffs also want the court to order the 36 state governors to recover from former governors and deputy governors what they have received in excess of the amounts stipulated by RMAFC as pension.</p>

<p>They are seeking, among others, “a declaration that the pension of a governor and deputy governor of a State is a “remuneration of a Public Office holder” in terms of Section 32 (d) of the Third Schedule to the 1999 Constitution and “condition and welfare of labour” in terms of Item 34 of Part 1 Second Schedule to the 1999 Constitution.</p>

      <p>On October 25, Delta State Independent Electoral Commission conducted local council elections across Delta State. Consequently, results were released for 23  council areas out of the 25. The other two were Ndokwa East which was cancelled and Ethiope East whcih was declared inconclusive.</p>

<p>The chairman of the commission, Mr. Moses Ogbe said the election was free and fair throughout the state ,  and pointed out that  some  politicians attempted to disrupt the smooth conduct of the elections in Ethiope East, but a few others were quickly checkmated with the assistance of security officials.</p>

<p>According to him, the election in Ndowka East was cancelled following a crisis which led to non-conduct of the exercise in the locality, whereas elections held in 12 wards out of the 20 in Ethiope East. Hence the run-off elections will be conducted in Ndowka East including the remaining eight wards in Ethiope East.</p>

<p>Confirmed Winners include Chief Edwin Clark (Burutu), Ifeanyi Osakwe (Ndokwa West), Chuks Obusom (Oshimili South), Francis Mauka (Warri North), Francis Eyiyere (Okpe), Solomon Pome (Udu), Kesena Kenneth (Ughelli North), Olukarefemi Felix (Bomadi), Paul Otega (Ughelli South), Baro Henry (Uvwie), Emmanuel Ebagbor (Isoko North) and George Ekpemupolo (Warri South-West).</p>

    <div>
      <p>The Senate was unable to immediately form a quorum a day after the House of Representatives voted for constitution amendment. This occured because the number of senators present were not up to the two-third requirement of members' attendance.</p>

<p>Consequently, the situation was remedied at the Senate proceedings on Tuesday (October 21, 2014). The senate formally consented to 23 of the 71 new amendments to the 1999 Constitution. On the contrary, a major amendment they rendered invalid is the removal of immunity for executive office holders.</p>

<p>However, support was given for autonomy of local governments, independent candidacy for future elections, exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal High Court for trial of election offences, as well as civil or criminal sanctions‎ for failure or neglect to obey summons issued to anyone by the National Assembly.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in order to ensure  accountability and efficient service delivery, the amendment enables funding of the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation, Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation, National Security Agencies, the Nigeria Police and the Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission directly from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</p>

<p>The process leading to the amendment of the 1999 constitution continues. This new amendments are to be forwarded to state houses of assemblies, where each item would require the concurrence of two thirds of the 36 state assemblies.</p>

      <p>The House of Representatives on Wednesday (October 15) in Abuja voted to effect 71 amendments to sections of the 1999 constitution. Areas covered by this include legislative immunity, local government autonomy, state creation, indigeneship and citizenship, independent candidacy in elections, budgetary process, revenue allocation, life pension for National Assembly heads and role for traditional rulers.</p>

<p>The new amendment makes it mandatory for the president to address a joint meeting of the National Assembly once a year and for the house to bypass the president if he failed to sign a bill presented to him within 30 days. On the contrary, they rejected the amendment of Section 9 to allow for a referendum in determining the fate of the National Conference recommendations.</p>

<p>To amend the constitution, a two-third vote (240 of the 360 members) is required. 261 of the 360 house members participated in the process. Of these, 252 members voted in favour of the amendments, eight voted against and one abstained.</p>

<p>A major highlight of the endorsement was the removal of the immunity clause for the President, the Vice President, the governors and their deputies. By implication, occupiers of the offices can be tried for criminal offences while still in office.</p>

<p>The report is to be forwarded to the 36 state Houses of Assembly for their concurrence. Within seven days, the President of the Senate shall convene a joint sitting of the National Assembly to reconsider the bill. If passed by two-thirds majority of members of both Houses at such joint sitting, the Bill shall become law and the assent of the President shall not be required</p>

    <p class="meta">October 9, 2014</p>

    <div>
      <p>The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has ordered the Chief Judge of Adamawa State to immediately swear-in Mr Bala Ngilari as the Governor of the State. This is just three days to the bye-election scheduled by INEC in the state. The initial governor, Nyako, was impeached by lawmakers after reviewing the report of a panel of inquiry set up to investigate allegations  of financial impropriety against him and his deputy (Ngilari ).</p>

<p>Mr Ngilari was earlier reported to have resigned from office to avoid being impeached by the lawmakers alongside Mr Nyako. While Mr Fintiri was sworn-in as the Acting Governor after the House impeached the Murtala Nyako. However, Mr. Ngilari, whose office was declared vacant on July 15 by the state’s lawmakers after he purportedly resigned, later challenged the legality of his resignation and filed a suit before the Federal High Court in Abuja, seeking an order compelling his swearing in as the governor of the state.</p>

<p>He revealed that his resignation letter was in breach of the provisions of sections 306(1), (2) and (5) of the 1999 Constitution because it was addressed to the Speaker and acted upon by the House of Assembly. But based on constitutional requirement, a deputy governor can only resign by submitting his letter of resignation to the governor.</p>

<p>Justice Adeniyi Ademola of The Federal High Court, while delivering his judgment, ruled that Ngilari’s letter was written at a time when Nyako had not been removed, thus implying that the letter ought to have gone through Nyako as then governor, which it did not, thus rendering the resignation null and void.</p>

<p>The Judge declared Fintiri’s occupation of the Governor’s office as illegal and ordered the State’s Chief Judge or President of the Customary Court of Appeal to swear in Ngilari forthwith. The court also ruled that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should not conduct the bye-election scheduled for October 11. The oath of office was administered by the President, Customary Court of appeal Justice Andu Lagre and Ngilari has appointed Mallam Chubado Tijani as his chief of Staff. Meanwhile, Governor Nyako’s suit challenging his impeachment by the Assembly is still on going.</p>

    <p class="meta">August 7, 2014</p>

    <div>
      <p>As we approach 2015 elections, now more than ever, we should look at the records of our elected officials. Have they really kept their promises?</p>

<p>The following article appeared in the Y! Naija publication and discusses some of the factors that will affect how people will vote, particularly in Northern Nigeria.</p>

<h3>When the elections come – How will the North vote in 2015? (YNaija Long Read) by Mark Amaza</h3>

<p>In the week of Christmas 2013 the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Jigawa held rallies in the three senatorial zones of the state to drum up support for the local government elections – to hold on 18 January this year. As the ruling party in the state, the PDP was not prepared to concede ground in any of the 25 local government areas.</p>

<p>Like most of the states, the tenures of the local government chairmen had expired long ago, with interim chairmen put in place as a stopgap, and as political tactic to consolidate the hold of the party in the local governments.</p>

<p>To ensure maximum effect at the rallies, the PDP rolled out all the big names in the state chapter, with the three senators from the state on the speaking roster.</p>

<p><strong>Power to the people</strong></p>

<p>They didn’t bargain for Birniwa.</p>

<p>At the rally for the North-West Senatorial Zone, when it was time for Senator Abdulmuminu Usman Zarekeu to speak, a low murmur began to rise from the crowd.</p>

<p>It soon turned to a chant.</p>

<p>“Bamayi, bamayi (We are not in support of you)!” the crowd repeated the politician’s nightmare in Hausa.</p>

<p>Undeterred, Senator Zarekeu continued to make his way to the makeshift stage. And so the chants rose higher – and the message more urgent.</p>

<p>“Bamaso, bamaso (We don’t want you, we don’t want you)!”</p>

<p>And then, the water sachets began to be thrown – at the Senator. The hitherto well-behaved crowd was on the verge of a mob.</p>

<p>That was when the good Senator got the message. He stepped back and dropped all notion of stirring the people up for his party’s candidates in the local government elections.</p>

<p>At almost the same time, the exact same scenario was playing out in the North-East Senatorial Zone; Senator Zarekeu’s colleague, Abdulaziz Usman Tarabu the target of the chants and heckling this time.</p>

<p>He was supposed to speak at the rally in Miga, the headquarters of Miga Local Government Area. At that gathering, the PDP candidates of the seven local government areas that make up the Dutse Emirate Council were to be presented to the electorate by the state governor, Sule Lamido.</p>

<p>But as he mounted the podium, the crowd, mostly of young people, started chanting:</p>

<p>“Bamaso, kasauka, ba ka yi mana komai ba (We don’t want you, come down, you have done nothing for us; we do not want you)!”</p>

<p>Tarabu was the more courageous of the two however, stubbornly mounting the podium and proceeding to speak… until the chanting became so intense, it all ended up an embarrassment to the personalities present, led by the governor. He had to step down.</p>

<p>The evidence would appear to be clear, despite grumbling about opposition warfare – not only is there a deep sense of disenchantment with the senators among the electorate of Jigawa’s North-West and North-East Senatorial Zones, but the disregard for the slew of politicians present makes clear the verdict of the states votes: the elected are performing well below expectation.</p>

<p>That disenchantment however is not peculiar to Jigawa.</p>

<p><strong>Minding our business</strong></p>

<p>Being a legislator in Nigeria is a tricky job – on the one hand, it comes with much less pressure than, say, the governor or the president. A senator or member of the House of Representatives is not in charge of large budgets and governments. On the other, it is difficult to explain their utility to a large section of electorates suspicious of paying people simply to talk.</p>

<p>The result of this is an increasing focus on the amounts they earn as salaries and allowances, considered excessive by a large section of the Nigerian public, and the budgetary allocations they are given to develop their constituencies.</p>

<p>Therefore, while the job of parliament across the world is to deliberate on laws for the betterment of their people, and oversight over the executive, anecdotal evidence now proves that a legislator in Nigeria who concentrates only on lawmaking, no matter how excellent he is at that, may risk losing an election.</p>

<p>In between ethnicity, faith, zoning and other narrow factors that influence elections in Nigeria, a smart politician in the legislature knows that he also has to make his presence at the legislature felt beyond making laws which the bulk of the voting population may not understand (with adult literacy rate in Nigeria at 61% – at least 30million Nigerians of voting age can neither read nor write, which is almost half of the registered 73.5million voters in 2011).</p>

<p>He has to come home frequently to embark on projects such as building school blocks, donating books, launching water projects and any other project that puts him in direct touch with his constituents and shows him to be working – not to mention the ‘stomach infrastructure’ projects, where he issues monetary handouts directly to the people.</p>

<p>The most effective Nigerian legislators therefore are those excellent both at legislative duties – being vocal on the floor and in committees, raising motions and sponsoring bills – as well as constituency duties.</p>

<p>With limited constituency budgets however, yet a larger-than-life image, it is no wonder so many are so disenchanted with their representatives.</p>

<p>But its not just the legislators – disenchantment is now an accessory to democracy across the North, if not across the whole country.</p>

<p><strong>Kano’s emerging war</strong></p>

<p>Kano is undoubtedly the most important state in Northern Nigeria – and one of the most in the country. The last population census, 2006, identified the state as the most populous state in the country with 9.32million.</p>

<p>It is also the economic capital of the North; its own capital, Kano the second largest city in Nigeria with a history of commerce that stretches back several centuries pre-colonisation – when the city of Kano served as the southernmost point of the famous trans-Saharan trade routes, with textile materials, leather and grains being the principal exports to North Africa.</p>

<p>It is also the birthplace of radical Northern politics, most notably, the Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU) and the Peoples’ Redemption Party (PRP) in the First and Second Republics, led by the late Mallam Aminu Kano.</p>

<p>They styled themselves as the anti-establishment party loved by the mass, in contrast to the Northern Peoples’ Congress (NPC) in the First Republic led by the Premier of Northern Nigeria and Sardauna of Sokoto, Sir Ahmadu Bello and the National Party of Nigeria (NPN), which produced the former president, Shehu Shagari in 1979.</p>

<p>Kano is highly coveted during elections – it has a voter population of 5.1million (as at 2011), only second to Lagos with 6.2million. It, naturally, also has the highest number of seats in the House of Representatives – 21.</p>

<p>At the onset of Nigeria’s return to democracy in 1999, the PDP had a vice-like grip on the state – it had after all won the governorship, all three senate seats and 18 out 23 seats from the state in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>However, in 2003, the combination of former Head of State and presidential candidate for the All Nigerian People’s Congress (ANPP), General Muhammadu Buhari, easily the most popular politician in the North since Sir Ahmadu Bello, and sympathy votes for the ANPP governorship candidate, a certain Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau who had been demoted to rector of the State College of Arts, Sciences and Remedial Studies from his position as permanent secretary in the state civil service, led to heavy losses for the PDP.</p>

<p>Not only did the then (and present) governor, Rabi’u Kwankwaso lose his seat, but votes were cast for the ANPP across all the elective positions. It was such a heavy hit that the PDP, which had held all but 23 of the seats in the lower house, was down to eight, with the ANPP winning the remaining 14 seats.</p>

<p>In fact, to hear them tell it, one of the elected senators – very confident of winning -was sleeping in his house on Election Day when he was informed he had won election. The ANPP was also so sure of victory, it only needed to seek a candidate.</p>

<p>This was to repeat itself in the 2007 elections, as the ANPP once again swept 21 seats in the House, and two out of the three senatorial seats in the state.</p>

<p>The bandwagon voting didn’t lead to the same effect in governance, however. Many of the legislators were lame ducks in the National Assembly, with no record of impact, through project or lawmaking. They were ripe for a change in the next elections.</p>

<p>In 2011, the competition was intense: Kwankwaso was taking another shot at the governorship as his successor; Shekarau had reached the constitutional two-term limit. Shekarau had also his denied his deputy governor, Abdullahi Gwarzo, the governorship ticket of the ANPP, causing him to move to the now-defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), and Buhari’s party, the CPC, was participating in its first elections, hoping to ride on the General’s popularity to win.</p>

<p>Added to that was increased voter awareness. 12 years of uninterrupted democracy had taught the citizens not to vote en masse from one party. The result was winners cherry-picked at different levels, from different parties.</p>

<p>The PDP won 11 seats in the House of Representatives and all three senate seats. The ANPP won eight seats while the CPC won the last two.</p>

<p>So far, only one federal legislator from the state has been undefeated since 1999. Hon. Farouk Lawan (Bagwai/Shanono) whose national reputation was brought down by his ignominious role in the fuel subsidy bribe scandal of 2012 suffers no such deficit at home. In the north, he is one of the National Assembly’s most prominent faces in the National Assembly, vocal within the House and also popular at home courtesy of numerous – effective – projects.</p>

<p>“I believe that now that Kwankwaso has joined the APC, the combination of his popularity and that of General Buhari will enable the party to sweep the federal legislative seats in the state,” Salihu Tanko Yakasai, a radio broadcaster and member of Nigeria’s new opposition coalition, the All Progressives Congress (APC) says of the 2015 elections.</p>

<p>Kwankwaso was one of five PDP governors that defected in November 2013 and is already being mentioned as a possible presidential candidate for the party. His popularity within the state is built on numerous infrastructural projects including two flyover bridges within the city.</p>

<p>“Although the PDP has been trying to shore up the loss of Kwankwaso by wooing his predecessor, Shekarau who is said to be unhappy with the way he is sidelined in addition to the presence of Mohammed Abacha, it will still be an uphill climb for the party in winning the state,” Yakasai says. “The biggest risk for the party will be if it imposes candidates during the elections, which may cause the voters vote for the PDP in protest.</p>

<p>“This had happened during the transitional program of former military president, General Ibrahim Babangida in 1992 where the imposition of Magaji Abdullahi by party bigwigs as the candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) made people vote for Kabiru Gaya (now the senator representing Kano South) of the National Republican Party (NRC)”.</p>

<p><strong>No peace for the plateau</strong></p>

<p>Unlike Kano, which upheavals are caused primarily by political calculations, Plateau is buffeted by crisis over which it might have no control.</p>

<p>It is almost a cliché now, but no less true for that. Plateau, once famous only for its scenic beauty and cold weather, has now become one of Nigeria’s most troubled states due to constant ethno-religious conflicts and mysterious, unsolved nighttime raids on villages where entire families have been wiped out.</p>

<p>The crises, which began in September 2001, have been on and off, getting so severe that the Olusegun Obasanjo administration had to declare a state of emergency in 2006, removing the governor, Joshua Dariye and installing an administrator to stabilise the peace in six months.</p>

<p>Dariye, like the president, was a member of the PDP, which has always had a solid grip on the state, winning all four governorship elections, and all but one senatorial race out of 12. It has also won 17 out of 24 House of Representatives elections in the state from 1999.</p>

<p>The strongest challenge to the dominance of the party came via the 2011 gubernatorial election. The Deputy Governor and former Minister for Industries, Pauline Tallen committed political suicide when she challenged her boss, Jonah Jang for his position. She moved to the Labour Party, a hitherto unknown party in the state, no doubt bolstered by the candidacy of former governor, Dariye for the Plateau Central Senatorial Zone through the same party.</p>

<p>Dariye won, but, as expected, Jang defeated Tallen resoundingly. Expected because the governor has become popular thanks to a slew of infrastructural projects executed and completed.</p>

<p>The state’s defining crisis also played a crucial role. There were rumors that Tallen had gone into alliance with the minority Hausa Muslim community, considered to be settlers within the state, who many accuse of fomenting the crises.</p>

<p>When Tallen took her campaign to Angwan Rogo, a predominantly Hausa area in the state capital, Jos, and wept openly on what she termed ‘injustice to the Hausa people’, the indigenous people did not need to look further for evidence of the ‘said alliance’. She ended up winning 35.37% of a total of the 1.3m votes cast in the elections. To complete the humiliation, when the results were declared, women famously trooped out en masse to sing songs celebrating her defeat.</p>

<p>The Plateau people have showed themselves very engaged beyond this. It is in fact one of the very few states in Nigeria where there has been a serious attempt to recall a legislator. In 2006, the Deputy Senate President, Ibrahim Mantu, who was representing Plateau Central, found himself battling to keep that seat.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for those behind the recall attempt, they were unable to get the required one-half of signatures of all the registered voters in the district. So the voters simply waited – and voted him out at next elections.</p>

<p>“It cannot be said with certainty if the present set of legislators will win (next year),” said Ibrahim Faruk, a civil society activist based in Jos.” A lot depends on what will play out within the parties, where some legislators might likely not win the tickets to run for re-election.</p>

<p>“The PDP still remains highly rated to win most of the seats in the 2015 elections: apart from its lone senator, Dariye, who is tipped to retain his seat, the LP has gone back into the obscurity from where it emerged in 2011; the APC might likely win the Wase Federal Constituency as usual (it used to be the ANPP that always won), which the PDP has found it a nut too hard to crack. A major factor behind the inability of the PDP to win this constituency has been due to the overwhelming Fulani Muslim population, where it is perceived as a Christian party, although the PDP is said to be working hard to win the constituency in 2015.</p>

<p>“Most of the battles will be within the PDP. As at yet, no one has formally declared for any of the positions, although that does not mean that the politicians interested are not strategizing for the offices of their choice. Most are waiting upon Jang, who as the party leader shall install the candidates of his choice to run in the election.”</p>

<p>There are rumors Jang – also factional chairman of the Nigeria Governor’s Forum – is also interested in running for the Senate. A source close to the governor, who declined to be named, confirmed this to me.</p>

<p>“When the winner of the 2011 senate election for Plateau North, Gyang Dantong died in July 2012 and a bye-election was held, Jang was said to have installed his Chief of Staff, G.N.S. Pwajok as the PDP candidate who went on to win the election, to hold the office for him till 2015, when they will likely swap offices, as Pwajok has also been mentioned as a possible successor to Jang, who is very popular within the state,” he said.</p>

<p>For Plateau South Senatorial Zone, its representative, Victor Lar, is reportedly preparing for a run for Government House, Jos – no matter the risk of losing his seat in the process.</p>

<p>Another legislator that is popular with his constituents is Bitrus Kaze, who represents the Jos East/Jos South Federal Constituency. However, he faces a common challenge: an agitation by a section of the Berom ethnic group to have one of their own replace Kaze, who is of the Anaguta ethnic group and has been in the House since 2007.</p>

<p>Another possible intense race will be for the Mangu/Bokkos Federal Constituency, where a rumored interest from the Secretary to the State Government, Professor Shedrack Best, who is a close Jang ally, might scuttle the re-election chances of Hon. Aminu Jonathan.</p>

<p><strong>Rumble in the Savannas</strong></p>

<p>An hour and thirty minutes from Jos, Bauchi, capital of the state by same name, has been birthplace of legendary political careers from the North, including Nigeria’s first Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and radical Northern politician, Mallam Aminu Kano.</p>

<p>At the inception of the Fourth Republic in 1999, the state was won by the PDP at all levels. The party couldn’t repeat that feat in the 2003 presidential elections howewver. The ANPP’s candidate, Muhammad Buhari swept most of the states in the North, including Bauchi.</p>

<p>PDP proceeded to lose the state governorship for the first time when the former Minister of Aviation, Isa Yuguda was schemed out of getting the party ticket by his erstwhile political ally and the governor, Ahmadu Mu’azu. Yuguda decamped to the ANPP and combined his popularity with that of Buhari’s to win the Government House. The party also won two senate seats and most of the federal constituencies.</p>

<p>Not that the people have much felt like winners over the same period.</p>

<p>There have been two attempts to recall legislators in Bauchi State: the first in 2009 to recall the senator representing Bauchi South Senatorial District, Bala Mohammed. Mohammed, who was an ANPP member, had consistently tongue-lashed Governor Yuguda for decamping to the PDP after being elected on the platform of the ANPP, and accused him of betrayal. This did not go down well with Yuguda who is said to have begun the drive to recall Senator Mohammed.</p>

<p>He was reasonably assured of succeeding before Mohammed’s saving grace – he was appointed minister by President Goodluck Jonathan in 2010, a reward for his role pushing through the doctrine of necessity that brought Dr. Jonathan into office. Ironically, Senator Mohammed did not take too long to join Yuguda in the PDP after he became the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory. He is now working hard to succeed Yuguda as the governor, even constituting a 12-man committee to visit all six emirates.</p>

<p>Ibrahim Adamu Gumba was the second target for recall. The senator presently representing the Bauchi South Senatorial Zone, a group called the Youth for Democracy confronted Adamu Gumba. The group claimed to have gotten close to half the signatures required as at May 2013. Then it disappeared. Nothing has been heard since.</p>

<p>What shall we hear from the electorate come 2015 though?</p>

<p>“It is very hard to predict specifically how the elections into the National Assembly will play out in Bauchi State, as the ruling party, the PDP and the opposition APC is still quite in flux,” said Jafaru Idris, who hosts a political-affairs radio show.</p>

<p>“Within the PDP, there is no assurance that the incumbents will get the chance to fly the party’s flag in the elections; like every other state, the governor calls the shots within the party. Also, some incumbents are looking to move up politically, such as the Deputy Majority Leader in the Senate, Abdul Ningi, representing Bauchi Central Senatorial District who is said to be eyeing the Government House, as Yuguda has exhausted his two-term limit. With this ambition comes the risk of ending up with neither his senate seat nor the governorship.</p>

<p>“At the same time, the APC is said to be making overtures to the incumbents to switch parties and promising them automatic tickets to contest the elections. If this happens, it will likely force those within the APC interested in running for the Senate and National Assembly to move in the opposite direction to the PDP.”</p>

<p><strong>State of Gombe</strong></p>

<p>The perception of political performance is almost the same in Gombe State, which was one of 6 created out of old Bauchi State by the Abacha regime in 1996.</p>

<p>Its first taste of democracy came in 1999. Since then, three governors have been elected, including the first, Abubakar Habu Hashidu of the now defunct ANPP, who lost his re-election to Danjuma Goje. Goje spent two full terms and is now in the Senate.</p>

<p>Its citizens give conflicting reports on the state of democracy dividends – legislators, for instance, spend a lot of time at home, but their presence is hardly felt in terms of constituency projects. They are conspicuous in ‘human development’, interpreted as the basic doling out of money to all who approach, but that is all.</p>

<p>You would think this dissatisfaction has led to a citizen reaction, at least such as Mantu faced. But that is not (yet) the case. The only attempt at recalling a legislator came for Goje, who is now representing Gombe Central Senatorial District. Don’t get too excited though – the state government led that attempt, after Goje fell out of favour with his successor and the incumbent governor, Ibrahim Dankwambo. Goje now feels so safe in his seat; he recently joined the bandwagon to the APC.</p>

<p>“A lot of the politicians will follow Goje to the APC as he is still very popular,” said Ibrahim Yusuf, who runs Society for the Future, a youth activism and development organization in the state. “While no one can deny that Dankwambo is performing especially in terms of infrastructural development, politicians and top civil servants are not enjoying his government because money is not flowing to them. The governor’s experience as an accountant seems to have influenced his frugal nature.”</p>

<p>Is there any sense of certainty as to how the state will vote?</p>

<p>“The fate of politicians is really unsure, as there is a lot of realignment in the politics of the state,” Yusuf explained. “More defections are certain to come, and it is not sure if the incumbents will even secure their re-election tickets. However, one legislator who is the man to beat will be Usman Bello Kumo, representing Akko Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives on the platform of the PDP. He is so popular that he can win no matter the party he runs on.”</p>

<p>There are many politicians across the north who desperately wish the same could be said of them. Unfortunately, the average Northern citizen has gotten more difficult to please with each election cycle.</p>

<p>Or, as some will say, fortunately.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/democracy-work-nasarawa-lawmakers">Democracy At Work: Recall of Nasarawa Lawmakers</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">August 5, 2014</p>

    <div>
      <p>If your community and you are unhappy with your lawmakers, there are steps you can take to engage them. You can attend their meetings, call them on your mobile or even visit their constituency offices to share your grievances. However, if your lawmaker has blatantly failed in their duties, you can find an answer in recall. To recall a lawmaker, you first need the signatures of more than half of the registered voters to submit the recall petition to the INEC Chairman. If signatures are approved then INEC can conduct a referendum. The referendum will pass if the majority of people that vote during the referendum vote for recalling the lawmaker. Then the lawmaker is recalled and a by-election is held to elect a new lawmaker.</p>

<p>_Thinking it has never been tried before?</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>The following article appeared in Daily Trust, and focuses on some people in Nasarawa that are partaking in the process.</p>

<p>FYI- Since the article's publication, the charges against the lawmakers have been dropped in a court of law, but citizens can still continue with the recall process.</p>

<p>IMPEACHMENT: NASARAWA SPEAKER, 5 OTHER LAWMAKERS FACE RECALL FROM CONSTITUENTS</p>

<p>Published on Sunday, 03 August 2014, Written by Hir Joseph, Lafia</p>

<p>Six of the 20 members of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) including the speaker of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly (NSHA), Musa Ahmed Mohammed (PDP, Nasarawa-Central), who signed the impeachment notice against Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura are facing recall from their constituency over allegations that they did not consult with the constituents to commence the process of removing the governor.</p>

<p>The other five members are: the deputy speaker Elisha Agwadu (PDP, Obi II), Mohammed Baba Ibaku (PDP, Udege/Loko), Abdulkarim Usman (PDP, Wamba), Francis Orogu (PDP, Keana), and Mohammed Sidi Bako (PDP, Obi I).</p>

<p>In two of the constituencies, namely Nasarawa-Central, and Udege/Loko where the speaker, and Ibaku are representing, respectively, the recall process has clocked two weeks and has reached the level of collecting signatures from constituents. But the other constituencies are merely beginning the exercise, apparently inspired by the two constituencies which pioneered the recall plot.</p>

<p>In Nasarawa-Central, the constituents have already set up a central committee headed by the chairman of Nasarawa Local Government Area, Tijjani Ahmed, who is coordinating the recall process with three sub-committees headed by a former LG chairman, Barrister Mohammed Sani Bawa for Nasarawa-Central sub-committee, and the state commissioner of Agriculture, Danladi Madaki heading the sub-committee for Udege, while Alhaji Ibrahim Gambo and Nuhu Abubakar, a former councilor, are heading the sub-committee for Loko axis.</p>

<p>The council chairman, Tijjani Ahmed, who disclosed the detailed process of recall in the two constituencies in his area, told Daily Trust, yesterday , that there are also Seven sub-committees for the Seven wards of Nasarawa-Central, as there are 44 sub-committees set up to coordinate signatories in the 44 polling units of the constituency.</p>

<p>He also said the two-week old process has seen the setting up of Eight sun-committees for the Eight wards of Udege/Loko, as well as 89 sub-committees for the 89 polling units in the area.</p>

<p>“We are on course, and signatures have started coming in from constituents against the two lawmakers representing the two constituencies of Nasarawa LG,” Ahmed said.</p>

<p>The state commissioner of Agriculture, Madaki told Daily Trust that constituents are “falling on each other to append their signatures against Ibaku,” just as Sani Bawa said the process first saw signatures pouring in from Angwan Dalatu polling unit where the speaker voted in 2011.</p>

<p>But Ibaku, who confirmed he is aware of the process initiated to commence his recall, said in a swift reaction that he is not bothered when the minority APC chieftains of his area made the moves. “I was voted by 43,500 PDP members of my constituency in 2011. My opponent polled only 13,000. If the 43,500 people who elected me say they want me out; I will be bothered. If disgruntled APC members in their microscopic minority are initiating a recall against me, I will be sleeping and waiting for 90 days our people to go a referendum to decide who is more popular in Udege/Loko,” Ibaku said.</p>

<p>The speaker’s spokesman, Tanko Ibrahim told Daily Trust on the telephone that “frankly speaking, I have no comments.”</p>

<p>When asked for his reaction, Francis Orogu confirmed the moves against him, but insisted that the process is not one to give him sleepless nights. “I have 100 percent support from my constituents to go ahead with the impeachment against the governor. I consulted my people, and they gave me the go ahead. Today, they are promising an automatic ticket because I did them proud by appending my signature to the impeachment notice because this government has come to introduce misery in their lives and those of their children,” Orogu said.</p>

<p>This is just as Lanze Kassim Ujah, a legislative aide to Honourable Usman of Wamba said he is aware there are plans by the minority APC members in his area to recall his boss, but added that “my boss consulted his constituents and got their approval. He is still in touch with his constituents if not for the threats on the lives of lawmakers by sponsored APC agents. The provisions of the constitution are clear on the role of my boss, and he applied them to the latter.”</p>

<p>The deputy speaker, Elisha said he got the mandate of a majority PDP constituent to represent the area in the state assembly, just as he insisted that he had the approval of the electorate to sign the impeachment notice against the governor.</p>

<p>Sidi Bako could not be reached at press time.</p>

    <p class="meta">June 20, 2014</p>

    <div>
      <p>The 11th Annual Lagos Central Town Hall Meeting was held on Wednesday, June 11, 2014. The purpose of the meeting was to encourage civic engagement and to report on the achievements and status of projects and programs enacted by Senator Tinubu. Unfortunately, the event was not as dynamic and open as most would have thought. Citing issues of having to meet a flight, it was said that Senator Tinubu would only be taking two questions from the public. One of the questions answered focused on the issue of the nearly 300 girls missing from Borno state and the inability of our government officials to facilitate their retrieval. Senator Tinubu began to answer the question from the angle of party politics, via her insinuation and blatant outcries against the current presidency and non APC members of the National Assembly. Enough is Enough Nigeria, CEO, Yemi Adamolekun, took the opportunity to stress the importance of cohesion in the nation to ensure the safety of all citizens and to bring back our girls as a response to Senator Tinubu's statements.</p>

<p>Several incidents occurred at the end of the event that were disheartening and further demonstrated the need for reform in the nation around the interaction of government officials and citizens. In what was a violent display of malfeasance, a colleague of Senator Tinubu was bombarded at the end of the event and money was eventually shared to "area" boys that proceeded to physically fight over how to share the money.</p>

<p>As we near election season, let us try to spread the vote that your vote and support for candidate is worth more than 500 naira. Let us actively push ourselves and engage our neighbors to realize that we all deserve good roads, access to quality education, ensured safety and security and better healthcare services. These are civil liberties and we should hold our government officials accountable.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/citizens-solutions-end-terrorism">Citizens’ Solutions to End Terrorism</a></h2>

    <p class="meta">April 18, 2014</p>

    <div>
      <p>On Monday, April 14, Nigerians woke up to news of another heart-rending carnage at Nyanya Motor Park after a bomb detonated. Over 100 people were injured and over 70 people died. That same night, over 200 school girls were abducted in Chibok, Borno State. This was enough to jolt most citizens out of nonchalance.</p>

<p>Tired of mere condemnations and the usual blame game, citizens on social media platforms responded to a call for suggestions on ways to combat this surge of terror. Over 1,000 suggestions were received in two days, with the hashtag #CitizensSolutionToEndTerrorism trending on Twitter on both days.</p>

<p> A further review of the suggestions and internal discussions has resulted in<strong> 10 key ACTION POINTS</strong> outlined below.</p>

<p> 1. FINANCING THE SECURITY APPARATUS</p>

<hr />

<p> The Nigerian public is concerned that the resources allocated to our security apparatus (N922 billion in 2012, N1 trillion in 2013 &amp; N845 billion in 2014) do not seem to correspond with the results delivered by those at the frontline to prosecute the war against terror. While it is understandable that security operations are mostly classified, citizens believe that some degree of transparency, accountability and disclosure is essential to gaining public confidence and achieving optimal results.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>a. Agents on the Field </h3>

<p>Citizens are concerned about the size, strength, training, and will of our security agencies to effectively fight insurgents. Similarly, citizens want to be assured that the welfare of our troops is given upmost priority by the government and military leadership. This includes, but not limited to, provision of (1) premium life insurance cover for security agents deployed to fight insurgency, (2) adequate compensation for the families of agents killed in the line of duty, (3) adequate care and support for agents injured in the line of duty, and (4) adequate reward for gallantry. Finally, reports indicate a disconnect between the troops on the ground and the command center. Our ground troops need the most empowering base support functions to be effective with their counter insurgency role and we expect that they are fully supported morally and with adequate resources.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>b. Weapons, Intel and Logistics </h3>

<p>The misinformation around the abduction of school girls in Chibok raises serious concerns about information sharing within the security agencies. Citizens want to know the technical capacity of our security agents to prosecute the war on terror. Citizens request that an independent committee comprising members of the Senate and House Committees on Defence as well as eminent retired military personnel be established to conduct an audit of the Joint Task Forces responsible for combating insurgency. The objective of the audit should be to ascertain the state of weapons, intelligence gathering and logistics in executing the war on terror.</p>

<ol>
<li>LOCAL SECURITY GOVERNANCE</li>
</ol>


<hr />

<p>While State policing is a contentious topic, we cannot ignore the fact that community policing is operational in various parts of the country. Citizens believe that government and the military leadership have not maximized the opportunity of well-designed local community participation in the fight against terror.</p>

<p>Communities should be encouraged to set up Community Safety Groups / Neighborhood Watch Groups. Community members know their communities better than the security agencies. They need to take an interest and connect with security organisations. There needs to be support and protection for the communities that are supporting the security agencies.</p>

<p>Citizens call on government and the military to design a robust plan of action and negotiate a unified template with local communities for participation in security&amp; intelligence gathering. Such a plan should adequately provide for (1) anonymous reporting of suspicious people or situations, (2) protection of informants who feel threatened, (3) rapid response to actionable intelligence, (4) feedback between military and communities, and (5) measures to mitigate abuse of mandate by civilians. Governors have a critical role to play as they currently support federal security agencies but there is room for more collaboration and streamlining of efforts. This issue of state policing must also be addressed urgently by the National Assembly and the National Conference.</p>

<ol>
<li>CONCLUSIVE PROSECUTION</li>
</ol>


<hr />

<p>‘Member of Boko Haram’, ‘Boko Haram financier’, and ‘Boko Haram supporter’ are labels that have been thrown around in a political war to embarrass certain citizens. The ease with which these labels are used, especially from the government, belittles the seriousness of the security challenge we face and the attendant death of innocent Nigerians.</p>

<p>The Senator for Borno South was once ‘charged’ for sponsoring Boko Haram and yet the result of the case remains inconclusive. The government has a duty to promptly prosecute alleged sponsors, and must be seen to be serious about it. It is not enough to promise ‘action’ while citizens watch themselves slaughtered daily.  Citizens encourage the executive and judiciary to work closely together on speedy trials for the critical impact of deterrence. Prosecuting at least 5 cases in 2014 would be a major milestone and would boost the confidence of citizens.</p>

<ol>
<li>PROTOCOL OF ENGAGEMENT WITH CITIZENS</li>
</ol>


<hr />

<p>There has to be a defined protocol for obtaining information and sharing information with citizens. During such cases of domestic terrorism, a public system through which information can be passed between citizens and the security forces must exist. The presence of such a protocol is essential to the protection of Nigerian lives.</p>

<p>It is unacceptable that in the last 4 years, despite many discussions, Nigeria still does not have a functional nation-wide emergency number. The 112 phone number that is being shared is not active in most states as it only works in states that have set up their own emergency services. Furthermore, in light of what happened to Yusuf Omisani, who was picked by SSS agents and kept incommunicado for 12 days, citizens need to be assured that when they share information, they will not be arbitrarily assumed to be members of Boko Haram and intimidated or victimised.</p>

<p>In addition, we suggest a monthly meeting between security operatives and community stakeholders in communities most affected by these acts of violence. We need an alternative that encourages more collaboration and information sharing to bridge the gap of communication. For the larger populace, the National Assembly should host Quarterly Public Hearings to keep citizens reasonably updated on the status of counter insurgency operations.</p>

<p>  5. FOLLOW THE MONEY</p>

<hr />

<p>The violence is being financed with cash. Terrorism involves the transfer of money in order to fund the procurement of equipment and manpower. The government must make efforts to ensure that financial services such as the banking sector’s Know-Your-Customer initiative is tied to its anti-terrorism strategy. Perhaps, through such efforts, we might be able to cut off their financial supply and trace the sponsors.</p>

<p>  6. IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENS’ IDENTIFICATION</p>

<hr />

<p>Our borders are porous and Nigerians do have family and allegiances to nationals of Niger and Cameroon. As a matter of urgency, we need to streamline the various types of data we have into a comprehensive database – SiM-Card registration (NCC), Immigration, National Identity Card, Civil Service Commission, Driver’s License/ License Plates (FRSC), Voters’ Register (INEC).</p>

<p>A central database where the identities of all Nigerians can be easily verified must exist in order for Nigeria to significantly make progress in fighting terrorism.</p>

<p>  7. RESPECT FOR THE DEAD</p>

<hr />

<p>Nigeria’s Constitution assures us that the security of lives and property is the primary responsibility of government. Given that lives have been lost to terrorism, the government needs to demonstrate respect for the citizens who have lost their lives in this act of violence.</p>

<p>The appropriate agencies of government should within 48 hours of any attack, publish the names of as many victims as possible using formal and informal identification. The National Human Rights Commission should be given adequate resources and support to create and maintain a database of victims of violence.</p>

<p>And, we must learn to remember them as a nation. Reporting victims as mere statistics is dehumanizing our dead brothers &amp; sisters and desensitizing our society, including our children.</p>

<p>  8. RISK CALCULATION AND MITIGATION</p>

<hr />

<p>For public spaces prone to attacks – markets, schools, and parks – a standard package of protection should be designed to protect citizens. Once made public, citizens can also be vigilant to ensure that their spaces have the required services.</p>

<p>  9. PROMOTION OF PEACE EDUCATION</p>

<hr />

<p>Government, religious institutions, private sector and civil society groups should invest more resources in promoting peace education. Peace education will help to redress the culture of violence and aggression and inculcate the value of peaceful coexistence and non-violent orientation on every citizen. Peace education should be integrated in the educational curriculum of Nigeria, from primary to tertiary education.</p>

<p>In addition, the problem of youth radicalization and extremism could partly be curbed through proper sensitization and enlightenment programmes using special designed radio and television programmes, jingles and group discussions. A robust countering violent extremism (CVE) programme should be an integral part of peace education. The Nigerian government, civil society groups and the private sector could partner with Nollywood to produce home movies in the three major languages (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba) designed to specifically counter the narrative, rhetoric and doctrines of violent radicalization or religious extremism. The private sector can play a crucial role in providing financial support for these programmes.</p>

<p>  10. SOCIAL WELFARE </p>

<hr />

<h3>a.    SPECIFIC PROGRAMMES TO EDUCATE &amp; EMPOWER WOMEN </h3>

<p>The world over, there is a clear and direct link between uneducated and unproductive women and poverty. Statistics have it that 2/3 of the 102 million poor people in Nigeria live in the Northern region of Nigeria, where women are the least literate and empowered. The North East &amp; North West zones have half of all the poor people in Nigeria, with more than 50 million people living in abject poverty and the insurgency has widened the gap even more. Incidentally, over half of the women in the North are married off before they attain the age of 16 and commence childbirth within the first year of marriage. Of the 16 million births by girls below the age of 18, 9 out of 10 of them are married. These poor human development indices only portend massive economic development costs for current and future generations. Governments, at all levels, need to consciously invest in women, if only to increase productivity, promote sustainable growth, their children’s wellbeing, as well as engender healthy livelihoods and establish peace, stability and security, in all of our rural communities. In seeking to harness the energies of the youth in a more productive and meaningful manner, a deliberate focus on education and empowerment for women as a significant strategy of concern is critical as they remain the foremost catalysts for rapid growth, peace and development in our country.</p>

<h3>b.    Creation of Job Opportunities for Nigerian Youth </h3>

<p>The Nigerian government must embark on effective poverty alleviation and human capital development programmes in order to empower its large youth population who are most vulnerable to recruitment and radicalization for violent extremism and terrorism.</p>

<h3>c.    Design and Delivery of Robust Programme for Destitute Children </h3>

<p>The Nigerian government should fund appropriately the National Council for the Welfare of the Destitute (NCWD) to enable the agency formulate and implement robust rehabilitation programmes for destitute children in Nigeria. Government at all levels (federal, state and local), especially working through the NCWD should partner with credible civil society organisations to design and implement effective reorientation programmes to reconnect these destitute children with their parents or provide them the necessary training that will help them function effectively in the society. Such rescue, rehabilitation and reintegration intervention is expedient given the finding that children who were not brought up by their parents are more disposed to using violence in propagating their religious views.</p>

<h3>d.    Enhanced Provision of Education and Literacy Programme </h3>

<p>Due to the high level of illiteracy in Nigeria, most young people have become easily susceptible to manipulation and recruitment into criminal and extremist groups. Although the right to education is one of the basic rights of every Nigerians, access and entitlement to this right is hardly attained. To reduce the number of people who are likely to fall prey to radical preaching and recruitment into violent groups, primary &amp; secondary education should be made free and compulsory for every child in Nigeria. Thus, what is needed is for the local and state government to muster sufficient political will to deliver quality and accessible education to more children in Northern Nigeria through enhanced allocation and judicious utilisation of funds in the education sector.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In summary, as we’ve seen in other countries, we cannot overemphasise that insurgency is not restricted to a particular part of the country – it is not a North East or Northern problem. It is trans-border and can move easily. The number of casualties in the last 3 years is estimated at almost 20,000. In the first 4 months of this year, we have lost almost 1,500 Nigerians, especially students, and hundreds of women and children remain unaccounted for.</p>

<p>We call on the Federal Government to ensure that our security agencies are equipped adequately for the task; engage communities; provide a national emergency number; honour the dead; prosecute swiftly and harmonise our databases for ease of identification.</p>

<p>The assurances given by the Federal Government are no longer sufficient and they MUST match their words with visible action to rebuild the confidence of the citizens in the efforts to protect lives and property. Nigerian citizens are desperate to see that we are winning this war on terror and for us, results are defined by the absence of abductions and deaths; cutting off financial flows; capture &amp; prosecution of terrorists, especially before they strike.</p>

<p>We call on Mr President for leadership that mobilises Nigerians to fight collectively against a common enemy. Mr President must extend a hand to ALL stakeholders in this war – governors, political party leaders, the National Assembly, traditional and religious institutions, civil society and citizens – and communicate clearly that this is not about party politics, ethnicity or religion, but about pursuing the common good of ALL Nigerians.</p>

<p>Our hearts go out to members of the Chibok community as we pray for the speedy return of our daughters.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>May God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>
